Chukwa‚Äôs Labyrinth

**Chukwa‚Äôs Labyrinth**

I started making a new TurtleCoin-themed game, ‚ÄúChukwa‚Äôs Labyrinth‚Äù! You‚Äôll have to go through a series of mazes in order to reach the prize at the end! So far I‚Äôve gotten player movement, a turtlecoin powerup and basic levels designed. I‚Äôm currently working on refining my tilesets and how I approach tilemaps. I‚Äôm using Godot Engine ‚Äî a free, cross-platform, open source engine. It‚Äôs extremely powerful, 2D and 3D, and is licensed under the MIT license(!). No royalties, no strings attached.

My game will be released under the GPLv3 license, you can check out the code at the GitHub repo. Big shoutout to @oiboo for making all my art for me, you rock. Also kenney.nl for his amazing artpacks! And also thanks to @GT3000, for helping me get started and giving a great starter resource

Proton Wallet ‚Äî A TurtleCoin Wallet

**Proton Wallet ‚Äî A TurtleCoin Wallet**

Hey everybody, as some of you may have heard, I‚Äôm developing a GUI wallet using the new and very capable wallet backend. The new backend was written by everyone‚Äôs favorite developer, the handsome @zpalmtree. It‚Äôs a really huge improvement over the old turtle-service based wallet applications as the wallet interaction is all done in pure javascript with no need for laggy RPC connections or mucking about running other processes, which leads to less lagginess and overall a better user experience.  
Down the road I‚Äôm planning on implementing some more advanced multi-address wallet features, and I‚Äôd also like to see it become a full-fledged multi currency wallet. I think many users are tired of having so many different wallets installed on their computer: a really nice multi-currency wallet could really attract a lot of users.  
Please test out the beta version which should be released in a few hours at <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtle-wallet-proton/releases> and get back to me with your feedback.

**TurtleCoin Added to Shrimpy App**

**TurtleCoin Added to Shrimpy App**

I wanted to pass something along for the weekly update. TurtleCoin has been added as a supported coin on Shrimpy this week. It is a cryptocurrency rebalancing app. It will automatically rebalance your portfolio based on your long term strategy.

## Good First Issues

_Good First Issues are tickets that are marked as ‚Äòeasy wins‚Äô for new developers. If you want to be a TurtleCoin Developer, these are great tasks to start with!_

* **Add type assertions for JS users**  
Currently you can pass incorrect types to functions without it throwing. This usually causes hard to diagnose errors. We should add assertions to check each type is as expected, and throw if not.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-wallet-backend-js/issues/16>
* **Add swap node method**  
Take an `IDaemon`, update the stored daemon (this is passed down to a few sub-classes, so might want to use the `initAfterLoad` method?), init this stored daemon, and start it fetching data.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-wallet-backend-js/issues/22>
* **Improve auto optimization**  
Right now we only auto optimize on receiving a transaction, when the wallet is close to synced. If a user rarely opens up their wallet, then the wallet may never be synced when receiving a transaction.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-wallet-backend-js/issues/24>
* **Daemon+WalletBackend timestamp adjustments**  
The current /getwalletsyncdata rounds a timestamp to midnight. Depending on what time of the day you start a fresh wallet, you may have no blocks to grab (we need to roll back a bit more than we currently do with the timestamp adjustment), or too many (since it‚Äôs rounding to midnight which is quite far away).  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/704>
* **Remove no longer relevant asserts**  
Since pretty much everyone runs the daemon in release mode, instead of debug mode, we‚Äôve ended up where we have a number of asserts which constantly trigger, due to altered/moved/rewritten sections of code.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/811>
* **QueryBlocksDetailed does not populate transaction extra ‚Äúraw‚Äù property in response**  
`.transactions[i].extra.raw` is not populated in the code as it should be.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/815>

## Bounties

_Bounties are a great way to earn TRTL for doing small tasks, and also a good way of getting things done if you want something made and have some TRTL to spend._

* **20,000 TRTL** Get TonChan (<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tonchan>) added to the TurtleCoin website, by making a PR to <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin.lol/> and having it merged. It should fit in with the rest of the website, so there should be an ‚ÄòAndroid‚Äô entry added to the existing Apple, Windows, and Linux options.
* **_100k TRTL_Merchandise** bot that will keep price for listed items in #merchandise updated in $TRTL according to actual fiat exchange rate without mentioning the fiat in the listing. @Elkim | trtl.urmom.lol 100k TRTL

Safari, y u do us like this

Shouts out this week to TurtleMax for pointing out a crazy CSS error on the main site when you view it in Safari. This one‚Äôs actually an old bug that we thought had been fixed, but it looks like safari didn‚Äôt get fixed at the same time. Good eye! ‚Äî Rock

Big thanks to the lads who were able to make it last week for DnD, it was really fun and I can‚Äôt wait to see what happens this week ‚Äî Rock

Also Thanks to xiaomogwai for this TRTL wallpaper :D
