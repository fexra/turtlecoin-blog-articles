**TL;DR — Scammers are pretending to hold “TRTLv2 Swaps” and are attempting to steal your money.**

The fact that this article had to be written at all just punctuates my disappointment in some of you. -Rock

I’m typing this article to prove in the most vocal way possible that there is [only one official TurtleCoin Twitter account](https://twitter.com/_turtlecoin), [only one official Github account](https://github.com/turtlecoin), and[ ](https://discord.com/invite/rhvXkWdz8A)[only one official Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rhvXkWdz8A).

We don’t have Telegram, at all, none of us use it either.

To check the official status of V2 and any dates related to swap, check the official TurtleCoin blockchain explorer [explorer.turtlecoin.lol](https://explorer.turtlecoin.lol/) or type `.v2` in the official discord chat server, in any room, and a bot will reply to you with a countdown, information, anything you need related to v2.

Please stop falling for this type of stuff. You don’t even have to read anymore, we put it in audio format for you. [https://podcast.turtlecoin.com](https://podcast.turtlecoin.com/) which is also in video form <https://youtube.com/turtlecoin>

**If you already fell for it, your money is gone, and you just learned a very affordable life lesson about the importance of literacy.**
