# Announcements

A new fork upgrade has been released! In this release we moved the entire network up a notch on the security score and set a static mixin of 7\. [If you don’t know what that means, we have an article about it right here!](https://medium.com/@turtlecoin/lets-talk-about-mixins-430730035297)

If you use a local daemon, please upgrade your software to the latest version of TurtleCoin. If you run a service like a pool or faucet and haven’t upgraded yet, you’ll notice walletd is now called service. New users are easily fooled by the word “wallet” so until walletd is on it’s own in releases, we’ll be calling it “service”.

# Developer Updates

_These are updates from our open developer community. We like to hear about your project whether you’re done or not,_ [_so be sure to leave an update about your Turtle project for next week!_](https://goo.gl/forms/TQ1XoykWFpyVUxVO2)

**C# Daemon —** _Hihi\~\~ Canti has started some great work on the C# port of the daemon lately. I didn’t want to leave it all to him so I’ve been helping out a bit — so far I’ve ported the public/private key cryptography, so we can generate keys which will work as they do in the current daemon. I’ve also ported mnemonic seeds, and am now working on deriving addresses from public keys working. We would love some help, so if you are competent in C# hop over to #dev\_general and maybe you can implement something too! Also — If you want to start working in another language, that would be cool too! Rashed has started work on the same stuff in golang — we’re really interested on getting daemon’s implemented in multiple languages, so if one has a bug, the whole network doesn’t crash._ **— Zpalm**

TurtleCoin OneClickMiner

**TurtleCoin OneClickMiner —**_Heyoo everyturtle! ;) Some weeks ago, I’ve written about the upcoming features for the TurtleCoin OCM and now the new version is finally out! Along with a ton of fixes, this new release comes with automatic saving of selections and settings and new help texts. I declared it a beta pre-release — if you encounter bugs or notice flaws, please let me know on Discord or GitHub! Thanks ^^_ 
_I’m looking forward to hearing from you!_ **— EncryptedUnicorn#7915**

Webwallet v2 (Work in progress)

**Webwallet v2 (Work in progress) —** _I started to create a new Webwallet with PHP using the Laravel Framework. It will be more stable, easier to use and more secure than the old one. It’s not finished yet._ **— cryptoBOOM**

**Athena ATHX Update** _— Block emission now requires 4 transactions to be in the queue before a block is created, ensuring that we operate with as little waste as possible. To my knowledge nobody else is doing this. Currently we are emitting one block per day on average. We’ll be beginning collaboration on a proof of stake whitepaper and implementation soon, along with an update article._ **— Rock**
