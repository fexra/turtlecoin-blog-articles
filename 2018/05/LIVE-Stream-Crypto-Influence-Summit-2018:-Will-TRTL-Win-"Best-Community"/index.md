## We are honored!

We have to thank the community in our[ Discord Chat](http://chat.turtlecoin.lol/) for helping us reach almost 11 thousand members in such a short time! We’ve been the most active crypto community out here, with a mission to educate people who are new to the crypto space.

TurtleCoin focuses on being the first place to go when getting started with cryptocurrencies and blockchain development, and making it simpler for new users to know how this technology works so they can build cool things too! From the beginning we have had an emphasis on mentorship, helping, and togetherness, and hopefully it helps us win!

## Are you in New York?

Our previous surveys and our usage map on [https://turtlecoin.lol](https://turtlecoin.lol/) show us that a LOT of you either live in a data center or you’re located in the northeast USA, so if you’re near the award show, go check it out and make sure you wear your TRTL shirt!!
