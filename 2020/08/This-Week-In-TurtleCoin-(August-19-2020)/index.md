## Boredom Killer #62

Today, for the fun of it, I threw together a quick little easily-deployable P2P, end-to-end encrypted messaging service class, written in TypeScript, which leverages TurtleCoin-Utils + the knowledge I’ve gained from developing TurtleTips. This library lets you encrypt and pass along any arbitrary data string you like between peers — could be used for a chat client, for sharing confidential data between two parties, or passing along any other information you see fit. I may clean it up and release it as a standalone library, or I may hoard it with the rest of my boredom-killing projects, only time will tell. (Insert :t\_devilish: emoji.)

## node-cryptonote-utils

Updated this package for major block 7 coming up at block 3,000,000 and added Typescript types.

I’ve been told that this package is still faster than the block template handling in utils for pool purposes, so challenge accepted.

## TurtleCoin-Crypto

Handful up updates published to NPM:

* Updated outdated dependencies
* Separated all interfaces out into their own Typescript file
* The user supplied crypto primitives must now adhere to the ICryptoConfig interface
* Better user cryptographic primitive function handling
* Node.js provided bindings via TypeScript or CommonJS are now async. This is a breaking change for many downstream packages.
* Added support for configurable Chukwa v2 & and other Argon2id variants
* Corrected issue with not including fe\_invert.h in \` (thanks @rashedmyt)
* Added support for FreeBSD (thanks @Izder456)
* Switched from TSlint to ESlint  
Additional tests added” IBMCD <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-crypto>  
TurtleCoin-utils “Lots of work going on here prepping things for ledger integration. Next release will be published soon.
* Abstract interface defined for LedgerNote And CryotoNote classes (which then makes their use interchangeable)
* LedgerDevice class used to communicate with the app on the Ledger Nano devices
* Incorporated the TurtleCoin-rpc-js package into the library (and kill the stand alone version)
* Pretty much everything moved to async/await (promises)
* Coin configuration abstracted our. Bye, bye config.json
* Added support for the Pool Nonce tag
* Added support for additional tx\_extra tags for coinbase transactions
* probably other stuff as well” IBMCD <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-utils>  
ledger-app-turtlecoin “- Added support for generating a transaction including full signing to the application on device.
* Slightly better memory management
* Few more helper and primitive methods exposed to the host application
* More CI/CD automated testing
* **IBMCD**

## Karai Updates

Recently Karai was wired up to get a steady stream of data flowing into Karai so that some of the data ingest methods and JSON serialization could be tested. To test these methods, Karai learned how to take in COVID19 data, Bitcoin price index data, as well as all of the trade activity of TradeOgre.com. This is pretty cool, and we even got JSON serialization half working, so that is a plus.

The current stagenet, Zeus, is happily chugging along pulling data and stuffing it into transactions that are smoothly being added to the graph.

Next on the horizon are fixing an issue where JSON is being encoded twice causing some forward slash escapes to riddle the nest data objects, and refactoring some of the functions in graph.go to make us a bit more well equipped to begin working on subgraph construction, which as you might remember is what gives karai its weblike appearance instead of a linear chain of transactions.

Also, Daniel\_Leedan has been nice enough to start working on a Karai transaction browser template that is based on the design of the new TurtleCoin block explorer, so it should look pretty cool when it is done! I was somewhat pounding my head against the desk while not looking forward to building one so this was a weight off my shoulders. Thanks Daniel\_Leedan!

Updates to the Karai website and documentation soon. I get so excited to write code that goes into the Karai core that I sometimes forget to keep the documentation and human side coming, so expect more updates to come!

* **Disable GPU mining on setup #34**  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/violetminer/issues/34>  
If a user has a lot of GPUs, but does not want to use them, it would be convenient for them to do this at first run.
* **Include README.md in releases #19**  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/violetminer/issues/19>  
Just need to update the travis config to copy in the file before zipping/tar-ing
