**Core Update** — For those of you who haven’t heard yet, at block 1,200,000 ([or in 17d 4h 17m 0s](http://explorer.turtlecoin.lol/)) we will be upgrading the network to a new hashing algorithm, CN Turtle. If you’d like to know more about CN Turtle and the fork, check out the articles below, but in short, it’s about renewing our commitment to keep ASIC off the network.  
If you’re a normal user, just update your core software or gui wallet and you should be fine, if you’re a miner, you may use TRTL Stak or XMRig, or SRB with more to likely follow. **— rock**

**TurtleEDU —** We’re so proud of all of the helpers who have helped us find bugs and corrections for the TurtleEDU class “TurtleCoin 101”! Who could have expected us to launch our beta semester with over 60 people helping us search for bugs, I’m so impressed.  
Next, Professor Fexra and I are looking for some Turtles in the community who are experienced with OpenEdX (the edu platform we use) to help us bring a more rich educational experience to you guys. We are looking for help with implementing the badging system, effective course design, as well as overall advice regarding the devops side of running an OpenEdX system specifically. If you think you have something to contribute, or advice to give, we’d be happy to have you, or if you’d like to try out our beta class “TurtleCoin 101”, swing by the Discord chat at chat.turtlecoin.lol and type \*student to get access to the EDU chats, and grab an account at edu.turtlecoin.lol **— rock**

# From the blog…

We are always pursuing a more fair mining experience. One of our early efforts to get the network to decentralize was to interview pool owners who had unique qualities about their pool to encourage new miners to adopt new pools. This next interview was more for pool admins and aspiring pool operators, and also just for general users alike. It’s a good one!

A while back, we had an actual journalist helping out witht he interviews, and this was one that slipped through the cracks and actually took a while to get published. It’s a great interview with a member of our core team, and I’m happy to show it to you! <https://blog.turtlecoin.lol/archives/interview-w-soregums-from-trtl-core-team/>
