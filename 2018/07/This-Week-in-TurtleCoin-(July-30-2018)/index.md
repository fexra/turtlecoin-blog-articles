**Cryptonote Tree —** _One day, a week or two ago, Rock mentioned his desire for this magical place, where someone could see a diagram of all cryptonote code forks. Just looking at github fork history, you end up with repo forks that don’t produce a coin, and you miss coins that don’t have the original fork reference. So I threw together_ [_cryptonotetree.com_](http://cryptonotetree.com/)_, and with some help from my fellow turtles, we have an initial dataset. The more community involvement, the better. Help complete the story by submitting a PR to_ <https://github.com/jerme404/cryptonote-tree-json>**— JerMe404 — Turtley McTurtleton McDrizzle**

**TRTL Coming to Bisq DEX Soon! —** _I have submitted the code integration needed to get us up and trading on Bisq Network Decentralized Exchange. Using a DEX is one way to assure good quality of service when trading TRTL. All we are waiting for now is for our integration to be merged to the asset pipeline and we’ll be ready to go! I’ll be writing an article about how to use Bisq as soon as we’re up!_ **_— RockSteady_**

**ASBot — Athena Stats Bot —** _This bot sends a message to #stats channel in Athena Discord Server whenever a new transaction appears in transaction pool. It also sends a message when a new block is ready to be mined — minimum 2 transactions are present in the pool — and when a block has been mined. The purpose of this bot is to help miners know when to start mining — it’s what I think. Huge thanks to fexra for supporting me in this project. Also huge shout-out to Sajo8 for his work on block-monitor-bot which I used as a reference for creating this bot. It just took me 3–4 hrs to complete the bot. It is my first bot and never thought it will be so easy to create one._ **_— Rashedmyt_**

**Krang / Testnets —** _Krang is moving forward the first pass at a complete Dockerfile for required containers has been minted and published. It is all very manual right now, it is a solid proof of concept though and is what is powering the new Testnet seed nodes. TurtleCoin will strive to keep 3x permanent Testnets alive. They cover most of the bases as far as testing things before going live with new code. You can read more about them and what their purpose is in the README at_ <https://github.com/turtlecoin/testnet.> _Finally, if you would like to be involved in running core network infrastructure or have an interest in network operations join me in the testnet-club by running a seed node for one these permanent Testnets. Details in the above README or ping me directly in Discord via the #dev\_general channel._ **_— SoreGums_**

**TurtleCoin Snail Races —** _Today was the first ever TurtleCoin snail race. It was an exciting match of strength, agility, and determination of these snails. Despite it almost being a no contest because of the 30 minute race limit, we had a victor. Watch the race to find out!_ **— RogerRobers**

Greetings, ye dwarvish miners, It pleaseth me to announce that following a disastrous Ceph upgrade (<http://lists.ceph.com/pipermail/ceph-users-ceph.com/2018-July/028153.html>), Funky Penguin’s NZ TRTL Mining Pool has been fully recovered for a week, and is now humming along, at 70–80KH/s, with blocks discovered roughly every hour, entirely due to our homespun charm and rugged handsomeness, and having nothing to do with math, statistics, or related mumbo-jumbo. Most of our hash is currently from the distant land of The United States of Mordor, so feel not left out if ye have not hairy hobbity feet, and come visit at <https://trtl.heigh-ho.funkypenguin.co.nz/> ;) (Update: By the time this message reaches you, I’ll have refreshed the pool UI to support email/telegram notifications (srsly, these are nifty little dopamine hits), mine-to-exchange, as well as more detailed stats and extra geek sexiness)
