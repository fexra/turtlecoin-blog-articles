**Hunter Faucet** — A new faucet has finally launched! Hunter Faucet is a TurtleCoin faucet with an extra twist to it! Referral links and special “Hunter Codes” are features of this faucet. Hunter Codes allow users to redeem more than the default amount of TRTL. Users can also create referral links so that they can refer other users to the hunter faucet for a small TRTL kickback. Happy hunting! **— Xaz**

**Vendible —** Vendible’s vision is to be the solution for the future global economy by building an all-encompassing commerce ecosystem. We are completing an integrated eCommerce payment gateway which offers merchants access to traditional credit and debit payments alongside Bitcoin, PIVX, IoP, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Monero, and Turtlecoin. Further developments will include a multi-currency wallet with brick-and-mortar POS functionality, a teller system for merchants which will facilitate exchange of digital assets, savings accounts, payroll and budgeting functionality, P2P payments, and more. We want to see adoption in communities which have cross-border ties as we see a tremendous opportunity for both merchants and users of the platform to transfer value. Vendible-to-Vendible transactions will not incur fees. We are led by founders and organization leaders from PIVX, IoP, Libertaria, and Sentinel and are creating a decentralized governance model where the people using the platform will decide the future of its development through a tokenized system which rewards use. **— Memnon**

**TurtlePay™ Explorer** — TurtlePay™ has been making moves with a completely rewritten explorer with a brand new caching mechanism that makes it super fast. To tell you the truth, I promised IBMCD I’d write something about it, but it’s about midnight and the bedtime beers are taking me, and I last second remembered the fact that I forgot to write this about two seconds before hitting submit. phew! — Rock

As some of you turtles may know, TurtleWallet is powered by TRTL.Services, which provides the backend logic and automation for creating addresses and processing payments and comes with an frontend API. The last month and a half I been extensively testing the platform with the help of TurtleWallet, which is currently the only active app build on top of this.

In the coming days, I will publish a detailed article dedicated to TRTL.Services — with all its upcoming features and nifty tools, but for this article I will primarly focus on TurtleWallet. I’m very excited to report that since the launch date of TurtleWallet (39 days ago), we have had no major incidents or bugs to report. However, as you all know this does not mean that there was a lot of room for improvement! Hence, this week I will be upgrading TurtleWallet and TRTL.Service and wanted to share some screenshots.

Statistics (39 days)  
— 309 users  
— 386 accounts  
— 7,181 transactions  
— 69,596,355.10 TRTL processed in payments  
— 311,383.99 TRTL in collected service fees  
— 1,357,557.81 TRTL in operation costs

New Features + Fixes:  
— Export sub-address keys support  
— Activity details (modal overview)  
— Graph bug fix + design improvement  
— Accurate conversion to 12 decimals for in total of 50 cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies and assets.  
— Recaptcha on login / register  
— Rate limiter on transfers  
— Account Oversight UI improvement  
— Dependency + library upgrades (including client side)  
— Improved transaction confirmation tracking

**rainborg —** I just wanted to give a brief update on RainBorg, as I know a few of you noticed she’s gone through some changes recently. Originally I was hosting her on a GCP server that I could no longer afford to run, so a member of our community stepped in to run her. Once they could no longer run her either, she went down for 2 weeks or so while looking for a new host. Thankfully Z stepped in and he now runs her! Beyond hosting, she’s also been getting some updates over time. A few weeks back she was updated to RainBorgCore (AKA RainBorg 2.0), which gives cross-platform support, and since then I’ve been slowly adding and changing things here and there to make her be more adaptable to our community’s forked coins that are starting to use the tip bot for their own coins. Once she’s fully ready for primetime, I’ll be ahead and do a small write-up on how to deploy her as well as tip bot for other coins. Also, while I’m here writing, here are her current top stats:  
Total TRTL Sent: 7,203,876.8 TRTL  
Total Tips Sent: 53,097  
Average Tip: 135.67 TRTL

**Traveling around Australia —** We are currently traveling around Australia showing people on the road and around where ever we go Turtle Coin. Since embarking on this expedition we had had truck drivers call us on the radio and ask what is a Turtle Coin and it has also been a conversation starter in some caravan parks where people are curious what a Turtle Coin is, some people have been interested and some not so interested once they find out it’s crypto related. If you are in Australia and have seen the van gives us a shout on discord and let us know. Later on in our travels we plan to stop at a Turtle breeding beach and see if we can either leave a sticker with them and maybe donate some turtles to some turtles. **— aneki**

**lite-blocks —** Last week I have detailed you guys what are lite-blocks and how do they work.. and here is the update in its development.. I have finished the necessary functions required to handle lite-blocks and request any missing transactions.. The only left-over thing is to add CLI-option to activate lite-blocks and logic to determine which peers support lite-blocks and which do not.. I hope with the help of iburnmycd, I can complete those things within no time..(bcoz he was responsible for the code which kicked unsupported nodes and also for the new CLI-options which will be in the next release) **— rashedmyt**

**Shellnet is ready for forking! —** The amazing Shellnet webwallet is now more forkable than ever. As it turns out, forking TurtleCoin gives you access to a ridiculous suite of complementary software and services. In fact, you can now get a very solid web wallet with very little effort! Check out my WIP forking guide for Shellnet! **— jerme404**

**TRTL-CLI-py —** I added support for cryptonote.social for the pool stats so it won’t crash anymore. Yay! I’ve also made progress on a command where you can grab detailed stats of all the pools at once, should come out in a few days **— Sajo8**

**Rewriting all the things! —** Now that I finished rewriting the wallet backend, I decided to start rewriting turtle-service, to use the new backend. I found a nice HTTP server library, and stuff was going well, but I was hitting a segfault when closing a wallet and reopening a new one.  
Basically what was going on is the NodeRpcProxy takes a reference to some logger objects, and when we destroy the wallet instance, they go out of scope. Normally, the NodeRpcProxy would be destroyed as well, however, since the code is a bit dodgy, the shutdown() routine doesn’t really work.  
To get round this, instead of waiting for it to shutdown, I simply detached the thread, leaving it running in the background to shutdown in it’s own time. However, since it takes references to these loggers, which are now out of scope, it crashes when trying to write a message to them. I attempted a fix, but then I got an even weirder error which I couldn’t figure out how to fix.  
I said screw it, I’ll just rewrite the NodeRpcProxy then. I haven’t though of a name for it yet, so I’m calling it Nigel. It shouldn’t be too tricky to use, since I can use the same nice HTTP library I’m using, and a nice JSON library. Hopefully, then Valgrind (a memory checker) will help me find bugs — When you run it currently, the code has so many bugs it prints out a few hundred a second so you can’t find out what’s wrong :(  
Back to the API — This will hopefully be a lot nicer for developers to use than current turtle-service. For one, you’ll open/import wallets via the API. This has a massive bonus of you not having to parse log files to find out if the wallet opened successfully or not.  
Second, you’ll be able to swap nodes without having to close turtle-service. This will allow for richer experiences where the software can detect if your node appears to have gone offline, and can offer or automatically swap to another node.  
It’s also using a more REST-like API — Thanks to Iburnmycd for helping me with this. I’m using Swagger (http://editor.swagger.io/) for the documentation — nice find Fexra — Which along with generating a really nice UI, will also generate API wrappers in something like 40 different programming languages for you — super cool! **— Zpalm**
