This week we tightened up our turkey gravy recipes as well as our core software while we reflected on how thankful we are to have such a talented community. Read on to find out more!

## Developer Updates

This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL project they’re working on. It’s a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we’re happy to see them all and it shows that we’re an active community.

Have you ever had a calculator on your belt clip? Of course not, because you haven’t won a crypto hackathon yet. Where’s the next crypto hackathon, you say? Well buddy, we’ve got you covered.

## **TurtleCoin Crypto Hackathon 2019**

We have 15 Million TRTL looking for a new home, and have 24 teams so far who’ve signed up for the TurtleCoin Crypto Hackathon 2019 (Signups open until December 1), and so far of those 24, 9 have left their details to be contacted during the hackathon for an article about their projects. That’s a great turnout, and a surprisingly even balance between devs and non-devs.

[TurtleCoin Crypto-Hackathon 2019To celebrate our 2nd year as a community on December 9th 2019, we are sponsoring the first annual TurtleCoin™…crypto-hackathon.com](https://crypto-hackathon.com/)

**We are excited to thank the following teams for their participation:** _ZenTurtles, Why Canti Think of a Team Name, Hero’s in a Half Shell, MobileTortile, Lord\_Enzo, that turtle, Kurdîstan, Born without a shell, Spanner Pouch, Hashterisk, AMC, JS TRTLz, TeamXenth, hebeblock, E Squad, Kick Ass Turts, Psychotic Silverfish, MXZ, Save the Turtles, eyegenvalue, termek, Oiboo Games, Double-O-Seven, ninja_

**Raw blocks syncing**

This week I’ve been working on adding raw block syncing to wallets. So far I’ve just added it to zedwallet and wallet-api. Currently, when syncing wallets, the daemon collects blocks and transactions from the database, deserializes it, and dumps it out to JSON. The wallet then parses that JSON and processes the blocks.

With this patch, the daemon instead returns the unparsed, raw blocks from the database as JSON. We then perform the deserialization in our wallet, and then process the blocks.

The advantage of this is two-fold. The first one is that generally wallets are waiting on the daemon to supply more data, rather than busy processing blocks. This new RPC call is a lot faster to complete than the current one, and so when the daemon is serving lots of wallets, it means that the wallets will spend less time waiting to retrieve data, and more time processing blocks, which means faster sync times.

The second advantage is that the raw blocks are much more compact than the full block data in JSON, so data usage will be decreased.

The next step is to add this feature to the JS backend so TonChan and Proton can benefit from it.

**TonChan v1.0.2**

Small TonChan release going out today. It fixes a bug where you were unable to sync past a particularly huge block.

Also fixes a bug with node swapping when you changed screens before the node swap completed.

Finally, it fixes QR codes not populating the amount to send correctly in some scenarios.

As always, you can view the full set of changes on GitHub: <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-mobile-wallet/compare/v1.0.1…v1.0.2>
