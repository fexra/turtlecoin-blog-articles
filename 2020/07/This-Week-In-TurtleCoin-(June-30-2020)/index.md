_This one is a bit of a long read, and some of you might have noticed we skipped last week.. We have big news this week for TurtleCoin, check it out!_

It‚Äôs 11PM. Do you know where your Grandma is?

## Developer Updates

_This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL project they‚Äôre working on. It‚Äôs a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we‚Äôre happy to see them all and it shows that we‚Äôre an active community._

## Core Updates

**Boy oh boy were we busy this week.** For those of you following along with the release notes you know that the next release of core is v0.28.0 due out in about a month or so. We‚Äôve committed to make v0.28.0 the last release to include turtle-service. In celebration of moving away from that legacy service, we‚Äôve begun work on the next greatest thing since sliced bread.

What could be better than sliced bread you say? **What about a v1.0.0 release of the core software.** Woah‚Ä¶ a major version change you say? You‚Äôre damn right a major version change. We‚Äôre pulling out all the stops with this one. We‚Äôre introducing a PoW algorithm change (as Chukwa is quickly coming up on a year old) at block 3M, completely killing off support for turtle-service, and have overhauled the node (daemon) API to get rid of the ugly API calls (json\_rpc is dead to us). We‚Äôve replaced the API calls with a REST-like interface that is tons easier for developers to interact with. You‚Äôll also see brand new docs coming out for it (something like <https://meta.turtlecoin.dev/proposals/daemon-api/>) that lays it out beautifully. In addition, we are also introducing a few consensus changes to help everyone keep their sanity.

We will be addressing numerous open issues, increasing performance, and numerous other small changes to improve the core suite. Stay tuned for more updates. Got an idea? Open an issue or hit us up in discord and we will see if it can make the list.

## RocksDB upgrade

This week I got around to cleaning up a ton of warnings and errors that are generated when compiling with a newer compiler, such as clang 10 or GCC 10\. This also included upgrading RocksDB to v6.10.2\. Happy compiling!

## Coinbase address publishing

In preparation for the v1.0.0 release, I added a requirement for miners to include their public address in the blocks they mine. This helps easily detect network centralization by a single wallet, while still keeping the miner and his transactions anonymous.

## Karai Updates

* **We got a new contributor** this week, Hai Turtle who has contributed a few bits here and there after recently learning Go, the language Karai is programmed in. Hai is a long time friend in TRTL land so it was a natural fit. Thanks Hai!
* **We are getting dedicated fields in TurtleCoin** for pointers and notary transactions. Before, we would encode the info and stick it in a payment ID, which just felt dirty for all parties involved. Since Wallet API is changing some, I will be changing the Karai client software to adjust accordingly with our fancy new transaction fields. This sounds like a bunch of fuss over nothing, but I guess a good analogy would be sharing a room with 32 of your siblings and then getting your own room. Terrible analogy but its a roundup, sue me. Nobody reads the Karai udpates anyway :)
* **Progress Updates on connecting to channels:** We can now somewhat connect to channels the proper way. There is a complicated key exchange and signing process that happens over a websocket between the channel coordinator and a joining node. The process we are working on is a means of establishing a cryptographic identity on the channel for the various peers before we go full P2P.
* **Karai integrated with Matrix Chat**: For the last few months or so, I have been using something called Matrix chat, which is like discord or IRC, except anyone can run a server and two or more people can federate their servers together, which spreads out the duty of tracking message history etc. When we arent using Matrix chat to have encrypted chats with the other members of the Illuminati, we are using it to pipe Karai channel messages into the Karai matrix server. This is kinda cool to watch, and currently bounces the data field from transactions in the Zeus staging network into a channel. From day two or so, random people connect sometimes and send test messages, which has been fun to watch.
* **Zeus staging network has been moved to a different host**. Moving to a new host always has its quirks, like in our case where the subtle differences in the server provisioning UI led to me deleting the Zeus staging network twice so far accidentally. That has been lovely, so sorry if that messed up anything any of you were working on. I will be setting up some type of uptime monitor dashboard for Zeus that is hosted on a different provider in case there is an outage at the datacenter level. I have a bad habit of updating the code and then not updating stagenet or updating stagenet and falling asleep before I turn it back on, so a red light green light website thing would be cool.

## Moving Up!

It‚Äôs always good to be recognized! These are the people who gained new roles _in the community this week!_

**This week we got two new contributors that have been making waves in our little pond. Big thanks to both of you for your help!**

* **Daniel-Leedan** gets the role of Developer and Karai Developer for submitting code updates to both projects. Over the past week he has added a few finishing touch improvements on our websites, and has been a pleasure to work with. His GIFs are always handy too! Way to go Daniel :)
* Hai Turtle gets the role of Karai Developer for helping me out with some scope issues I was having and for showing me a better way to accept conditional user input. Hai picked up Go fairly quickly and was able to submit a few updates to the Karai core code that really helped us out. Hai is a familiar face in TRTL circles, so it is always a pleasure to have him involved. Big thanks!
