TurtleCoin on Ledger Nano!

## TurtleCoin® Ledger Application

**Have a Ledger Nano S or X? Want to use it to keep your TRTL safe? Check out the video… clicky clicky.**

I recently got my hands on a brand new Nano X and the first thing I did was beat it on ground and run over it with my car. After that, I gave it to do the doggo and let him play with it for a bit. After all, if I’m going to store my hard earned TRTL on one of these things, I need to know that it will hold up to abuse.

After I got that testing out of the way, I got to work digging into what it takes to make this bad boy work with TurtleCoin. I admit, the Ledger SDK documentation made everything sound so easy to work through. Let me warn you, it’s not. Looking through headers and source files and trying to keep your head straight while you’re working in C, thinking through how to fit everything important in just 4KB of RAM, and other fun limitations, is not an easy task. In any event, I’ve made some awesome progress in the last 5 days. The Nano is now generating all the necessary keys, exporting public keys, exporting the private view key, and some other basic functionality. I’m still working on completing the necessary pieces and as we all know… slow and steady is the way.

## TurtleCoin® V0.28 & V1

We’re happy to announce that v0.28.0 is shipping July 22, 2020\. This release upgrades RocksDB to v6.10.2, resolves a few minor bugs that we’ve found along the way, introduces a new TX\_EXTRA field just for the pool miner nonces (no pool changes required), and implements a consensus change that requires proof that coinbase (miner rewards) are properly claimed.

> This is also the last release to include turtle-service which means that turtle-service is officially EOL with this release. EOS for turtle-service is scheduled for v1.0.0 which currently planned to be out in time for block 3,000,000.

For those of you looking ahead to what v1.0.0 has to offer, we’ve got quite a few changes stacked up and ready. We’ll be introducing changes to the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm to help secure the network. The daemon (node) API has been completely overhauled and moves to a more RESTful style implementation versus the json\_rpc madness we have today. We’ve also nixed turtle-service, legacy WalletGreen support (this means if you haven’t upgraded your wallet to the new format used by wallet-api and zedwallet, you may want to back up your keys soon). We’re also working on a few other things that will make their way into v1.0.0 in all it’s glory.

Stay tuned for further updates.

## Porting turtlecoin-crypto to FreeBSD

![](./images/06w8Cp_hWNNNCFSBJ.jpg)

I ported the turtlecoin cryptography libs over to FreeBSD. They compile on FreeBSD now. Hopefully in the future we can get the turtlecoin-core compiling as well!

## TurtlePay® Blockchain Collector

I’m overhauling this bad boy in preparation for v1.0.0 of the TurtleCoin® core software. It’ll store raw blocks, it’ll be faster, it will be stronger, it will be better. I’d say it’s going well but after a week of syncing progress, i’m at block 1.5M. I’ll let you know when it finishes, til then, I think I’ll be working on a few other things.

## TurtleTips

After talking with iburnmycd a few months back, I started coding up a little project as a bit of a proof-of-concept for a semi-centralized, non-custodial web wallet — a wallet where _you_ control the spend keys, but a remote server does the hard work of syncing for you. Using this concept, an instance of this wallet, in theory, can sync up in a fraction of the time of conventional methods; as long as the backend is caught up with the network, all the frontend needs to do is play catch-up with whatever inputs and outputs the backend deems relevant.

Recently, I’ve started to rework and revamp my proof-of-concept into a fully-fledged chrome-based extension, with the added capability of being able to send tips to website owners who put their public tipping key up as a TXT record. At the moment, I am finalizing a few things on the front-end, which is basically done, then I’ll be moving onto the backend, where I just need to do a touch of code optimization.
