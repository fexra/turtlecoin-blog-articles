# Development Updates

TRTL CLI — TRTL CLI is a tool to check TurtleCoin’s network status and straight from your terminal. Right now you can check the latest price, networks hashrate, calculate your TRTL net worth or print a swanson with \`\`\`trtl ascii swanson\`\`\` thanks to Xaz’s contributions. Feel free to add new things and I will merge it right away, the code is really simple. — mrrovot

Gotta scan fast — You might have wondered when you create a new wallet — why the heck am I scanning all the blocks from earlier that don’t contain my transactions?! Or perhaps you would have liked to be able to import your wallet keys from a certain height, knowing when you created it.

Well, this functionality has now been added to zedwallet and turtle-service. When creating a wallet, no blocks will be scanned until it gets to the time of the creation. And when importing a wallet, it will prompt you for the height you created the wallet at, to only start scanning when it gets to that height.

Hopefully this feature will be added to the GUI wallets soon, so everyone can enjoy it.

One thing to note is that you do still have to download the hashes of the blocks before the start of scanning, so it’s not \*instant\*. It is, however, MUCH faster. From my tests, it took about 7 minutes to download the first 500,000 blocks, not scanning any of them. This was using a public node, so I imagine it will be much faster on a remote node.

Coming soon™ to a release near you — Zpalm

TurtlePi — Huge steps were made this week advancing our cause to bring TurtleCoin to the Raspberry Pi and ARM devices. Quite a few very appreciated man hours were invested making this a closer reality. Over the next week I am hoping to have a small image prepared for download that will include a web wallet and the ability to run a full daemon on the PI with a minimal 64 bit raspbian image. The long term goal is to load the disk image will all things Turtle and also a desktop so new users can download and burn the image to an sd card, boot up and begin their trip down the Turtle hole. — crappyrules

TurtleCoin on the Raspberry Pi — This week we got TurtleCoin compiling on the Raspberry Pi 3b+. Thanks to everyone who helped with this.

It works great, and I’m currently running a TurtleCoind node and zedwallet on it, so I can ssh in and and it’s all ready and up to date for me to use.

To speak to the motivations behind getting TurtleCoin on a Pi, I’ll quote RockSteady:

_“Efforts we like to focus on are educational in nature, for example our project “box-turtle” seeks to make easy to deploy raspberry pis with turtle wallets embedded in them for us to use when sponsoring hackathons for youngsters. This project has web elements as well as system coding elements, and even graphics if someone were so inclined, so it’s a great opportunity to get funding from businesses to supply those materials and spaces for us to engage with the community._ 
_It would be a great help to find sponsors for a few hundred raspberry pi 3b+’s, and finding hackathon groups preferably in areas with a concentration of Turtles where we can engage with youngsters and teach them a bit about how this stuff works. Our core mission is bridging the gap between those in the know, and those who are not. We would like to cultivate a future culture that embraces blockchain as well as development as a whole, so that when laws are made concerning our industry in the coming years, they’ll be informed decisions, rather than fearful acts of legislation.”_

There was a a 2.3 million TRTL bounty for achieving this, and it was pretty trivial to do, actually. So, if you’re a decent programmer, check out the bounties for a great way to earn some TRTL :) Thanks to Jerme for the decal ;) -Zpalm

TurtleCoin ARM For Raspberry Pi 3 B+ — The three of us recently completed the bounty as listed under the meta repo and the #bounties channel which listed a total bounty of 2,600,000 TRTL. It took many long hours of work but in the end the effort was worth it as now we have an ARM build that works great on Raspberry Pi 3 B+ — IBurnMyCd, zpalmtree, rashedmyt
