Nest GUI Has been updated :D

**Nest Wallet —** _“Nest has been updated to 0.23\. Upgrade is mandatory as it includes latest daemon which fixes some blocking bugs. Please note that the local blockchain sync option is temporarily unavailable (due to a bug in walletd). Only connection option is via remote node. Use the CLI (zedwallet) if you need to sync locally. Sorry for the inconvenience. We are working on bringing it back.”_ **_—_ Jon Nest**

**block-bot —** “_This bot, which is still under development, will send a message in a channel giving details of each block, it’s hash, the block’s size, the tx’s in it and it’s size, what tx\_extra is, and it’s size, and what tx\_extra hashes ought to be. If blocks are made in an untimely manner, like 7 second or 120 seconds within each other, it’ll ping RockSteady. This will be especially useful for Karai, TurtleCoin’s in development smart contracts on a side chain(its gonna be awesome)_” **— Sajo**

**TurtleCoin —** _“We’ve made a nice article here explaining to you guys where all the mixins went for those who are wondering :D”_

[Let’s Talk About MixinsWe are moving to static mixins, and we want to talk to you about what those words mean and why that’s important for…medium.com](https://medium.com/@turtlecoin/lets-talk-about-mixins-430730035297)

**Gladiator Bot —**_“ Gladiator Bot is still being received really well with people really enjoying the battles. With the introduction of potions, it added an element more than luck. Potions were introduced at +20hp gain but were buffed earlier in the week to +30hp to make them more worthwhile to use. With some devious Turtles causing their opponents to miss out on wins by simply stopping their attacks and letting the arena time out, an introduction was made this week for the last attacker to be awarded the win. Gladiator Bot was created for use on TRTL coins discord. A community coin with a bot built on community ideas. Ideas to build and improve on Gladiator Bot are welcomed and any ideas that pass the criteria of A) I think I can actually do it… And B)… Nope just A! We had a joint first place in the leaderboard last week but this week we are looking like we have a clear winner already. Good luck to all our turtle Gladiators and have fun!”_**— Caesar Rynem**
