## Developer Updates

This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL project they’re working on. It’s a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we’re happy to see them all and it shows that we’re an active community.

**violetminer**

I made some great progress on the Nvidia backend for violetminer this week. It’s now working, and hashing at a pretty decent speed. There are still a few more things I need to fix before making a release, however. Firstly, it instantly crashes on Windows 10, due to Windows 10 seemingly reserving about 20% of GPU’s vram. When I limit the memory usage, the performance suffers, so am not sure how best to solve this issue yet.

Secondly, I think I need to alter my code to use streams instead. With the current method, the CPU spins in a loop waiting for the kernel to finish. I believe this is the cause of hashrate being significantly reduced when CPU mining is enabled — the CPU is too busy mining itself to wait for the GPU kernel to finish.

I’ve been working on getting all the automated CI builds working with CUDA, so people don’t have to compile themselves. So far, Linux with both GCC and Clang are working, and so is Mac OSX — but Windows is being a bit of a pain to find the installed cuda toolset. I think I’m getting pretty close to fixing it, however.

Oh — I also need to check the miner works correctly on multiple GPUs. I think I’ve done the programming right, but don’t have multiple GPUs myself, so can’t really test.

I probably also need to add an intensity option for people who don’t want to run their GPUs at max speed.

**turtlecoin-wallet-backend-js**

More updates to the JavaScript/TypeScript wallet backend this week. Additions include…

* Auto optimization is now functioning as expected, so your wallet is always ready to send the max amount possible
* Using pre-generated key images to speed up transaction creation
* Improving error messages returned when the daemon fails to process our transaction
* Lots of logging improvements to help out developers debugging

Together with ExtraHash and iburnmycd we’ve also been doing a lot of investigation into some rare issues with wallet syncing, and wallet transacting. A ton of bugs have been found and fixed, so hopefully we’ll see a lot less of those weird issues when utilising the js backend or the blockchain cache.

It looks like the library is getting a fair bit of usage in different projects — I’m seeing the library getting downloaded over 130 times a week, and is now being included by at least 24 different projects on GitHub!

As a reminder to folks who may not know what the library does, it lets you run a full client side wallet entirely in JavaScript, with no other processes needed. This allows for a lot of options on how to use the wallet, given how versatile JavaScript is. It also allows a much more seamless and integrated experience for the users, as it does not require a flaky RPC API interface to be used.

I have a few more interesting features I hope to get added in the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned ;o

**Client Side Web Wallet**

Has been a slow two weeks, but wallet creation and storing them client side (locally on the device) works now. Next up will be to to create a simple login page and dashboard displaying transactions and balance. I will be pushing code to Github soon.

**BLOC GUI MINER**

BLOC GUI Miner is a beautiful, easy to use, Graphical User interface for mining multiple cryptocurrencies based on cryptonote. The BLOC GUI Miner is easy to use and makes you getting started with mining cryptocurrency on Windows, MacOS and Linux in no time.

It is aimed at getting people that have never tried mining before with a focus on accessibility, security and simplicity.

BLOC GUI Miner support two very popular miner backends: xmr-stak and xmrig

BLOC GUI Miner comes with XMR-STAK 2.10.7 and XMRIG 3.1.1 already built-in, including configuration files for CPU and GPU mining in most of the cases.

What’s new in v1.1.1 ?

* Updated miner setting to support the latest version of XMR-STAK v2.10.7
* Updated miner setting to support the latest version of XMRIG v3.1.1
* TurtleCoin now changed to Chukwa CPU mining algorithm
* Fixed a bug that changed the XMR-STAK CPU config when changing thread count
* Fixed draggable windows on macOS
* Added new cryptunit widget built-in
* Fixed Coinggecko stats for each supported currency
* Added new box with image and link on the left custom for each coin

**Contribute your Miner stats for Chukwa**

I put up a simple Google Form to gather stats about mining hardware/software combos. Contribute your stats for others to have a reference. The form is pinned in the #mining channel on discord for future reference as well.

**NinjaRig on Android via Termux**

Updated the guide for running NinjaRig (XMRig) on Android via Termux if you’re into that kind of thing :)

Thanks to Haifa Bogdan Adnan for NinjaRig it has been a bit of a hit with the move to chuckwa PoW hashing algorithm. As mentioned in the guide had to remove a part of the code to make it work on Android, hence why it pulls from my repo, which is kept up to date with upstream.

## Good First Issues

Good First Issues are tickets that are marked as ‘easy wins’ for new developers. If you want to be a TurtleCoin Developer, these are great tasks to start with!

* **Use matches property in ApiDispatcher regex #862**  
Some calls in the [ApiDispatcher](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/blob/development/src/walletapi/ApiDispatcher.cpp) use a regex, for example, `getTransactionDetails`. They then extract the query parameters. We could instead extract `hashStr` using the `matches` property on the `req` object, by adding a capture group to the hash regex.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/862>
* **Remove no longer relevant asserts #811**  
Since pretty much everyone runs the daemon in release mode, instead of debug mode, we’ve ended up where we have a number of asserts which constantly trigger, due to altered/moved/rewritten sections of code.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/811>
* **Daemon+WalletBackend timestamp adjustments #704**  
The current /getwalletsyncdata rounds a timestamp to midnight. Depending on what time of the day you start a fresh wallet, you may have no blocks to grab (we need to roll back a bit more than we currently do with the timestamp adjustment), or too many (since it’s rounding to midnight which is quite far away).

* greywolf thanks to those that were helpful in the past year with issues with my public node. but the latest update killed me and I can’t figure it out so I pulled the node down. thanks again to all those that did help before and I wish the rest of you good luck with public nodes still running, going forward.
* @MrLahaye Thanks @Rocksteady for buying my old NES on the #merchandise channel. My second item sale using TurtleCoin. :D Who’s gonna be my next buyer?
* greywolf a big thanks to zpalmtree for helping me get my public node back up, and also to iburnmycd for fixing my github errors in updating the nodes list.
* wll1rah bogdanadnan, thanks for the great ninjarig miner and the help that you have provided in getting to work with mali GPU with OpenCL.
