## Developer Updates

This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL project they’re working on. It’s a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we’re happy to see them all and it shows that we’re an active community.

## Github tip bot

Recently I have been working on a tip bot for Github which allows users to tip each other by commenting on issues. It is triggered by a command that discord users will be familiar with to send a tip, for example:

> **.tip 3.50 @username**

If the receiving user doesn’t have a tips account yet, any tips sent to that user still get processed and are available to them when they create an account. To create an account a user simply has to sign in to the react web app with Github auth and they’re all set.

It is also possible to set an optional time-out for unclaimed tips(tips sent to users who have not activated an account yet), if an unclaimed tip expires, the original sender is refunded.

**If you’d like to help test the bot ping me on discord :)**

## TurtleCoin® Ledger Wallet

Over the last week I was able to get Ring Signatures working on the Ledger Nano S. After doing that, checking ring signatures was easy. I’ve also exposed a few other crypto fundamentals that are used in wallet management in the event that we absolutely have no other choice but to use the crypto functions on the device (it’s not a fast as a host device — the Nano S sports a < 100Mhz CPU). Needless to say, as you can see, this the application on the ledger is pretty much all but “done” (knowing full well that development is never done).

I’ve set up the CI/CD pipeline for the project with GitHub actions including Unit Tests against the Nano S emulator, making it very easy to tell when something isn’t working. I used the same test script but pointed at a real Ledger Nano S to create the video you see here.

There are a number of tools that I’m also building out for talking to the application when it’s running on the Ledger. See the rest of my updates for more :)

## TurtleCoind® Crypto Library

Just rolled a new major version of the TurtleCoin crypto library v5.0.0\. A few minor bug fixes are included but the biggest change is that the TS/CommonJS exports are all async now, which will pave the way for going down into the actual C++ code to make them asynchronous. As a bonus, the library now includes the code for Chukwa v2 as well as a few utility functions to make it easier to handle any other Argon2id variants.

## TurtleCoin® Utilities Library

With the recent changes to TurtleCoin-crypto going full async, there were a number of changes that had to take place in this library as well. Most of the updates taking place in the library are related to that and as soon as I’m 100% comfortable it’s ready, I’ll bundle up the release. This next release will also be a major version change as the async changes require a bit of tweaks to downstream code and thus broke the API expectations.

In addition, I’ve added a small export that provides the necessary functions to talk to a Ledger Hardware device running the TurtleCoin® Ledger Wallet application. You supply the transport mechanism (HID, USB, BLE, etc.) and the class does the rest. Every command supported by the application today can be handled via the class added to the library. Looking forward to start hooking it up to things wallets like Proton.

## TurtleCoin® Block Explorer

Did a couple of small updates to the explorer over the weekend in preparation for the network upgrade at block v0.28.0\. It’s subtle, and it’s not always there, but you’ll get it when you see it.

Also went through and updated the TurtleCoin® Utilities package deployed with the explorer as there’s some big things coming to the blockchain api that’ll open up a lot more data for the explorer.

## Good First Issues

_Good First Issues are tickets that are marked as ‘easy wins’ for new developers. If you want to be a TurtleCoin Developer, these are great tasks to start with!_

This **Good First Issue** comes from Zedwallet developer Zpalmtree who requests a brave dev newbie who can add two commands to Zedwallet. This GFI is cool because it gets you both a **Developer** and a **Core Contributor** role in the chat!

* `list_fusions` command for zedwallet
* `rewind` command for zedwallet, the same way as it is implemented in[ turtlecoin wallet backend js](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-wallet-backend-js)

## Shoutouts & Thanks

_This is the place to mention someone in the community who has done something nice or deserves recognition._

**Dreday000** Shout to the devs, working hard :) **@turtleMax** Shoutout to all the core developers that keep pushing code, slow and steady wins the race! **Anonymous** F&$k you Dependabot… rebel scum. Some of us have day jobs. You’re not even that good at yours. **@Daniel\_Leedan** I just want to say thank you to all the members of the community who patiently helped me with the new computer specifications and explained to me lots of technical issues. I learned a lot from you. I could not do it without you. Thanks Turtles.

## TRTL Dev Afterhours

_The afterhours section is a new column we are trying out that aggregates all of the links from #Dev\_OffTopic for the week so we can share them with you guys._

**Amazon Ion**  
Amazon Ion is a richly-typed, self-describing, hierarchical data serialization format offering interchangeable binary and text representations. Ion was built to address rapid development, decoupling, and efficiency challenges faced every day while engineering large-scale, service-oriented architectures. Ion has been addressing these challenges within Amazon for nearly a decade, and we believe others will benefit as well.
