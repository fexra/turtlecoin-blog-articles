**WalletShell GUI Wallet —** With v0.3.3 release, WalletShell, the TRTL Gui Wallet has been declared stable and ready for public use to manage your TRTL assets. Since its last introduction, WalletShell has fixes lots of known bugs & glitches, performance & features enhancements, and lots of new features, here are some of them:  
— Address book, which can be looked-up when you send/transfer TRTL, help avoid mistakes on typing/pasting recipient address  
— Fast transaction history listing/sorting/searching  
— Keyboard only operation, with help of keyboard shortcut & keyboard friendly inputs.  
— Public node list, fetch daily from <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-nodes-json/blob/master/turtlecoin-nodes.json.>  
\-For node operator: You don’t need to worry that your node domain name starts with “z”, node list order will be randomized everytime user accessing node setting page, so each nodes has a relatively fair chance to be on top of the list.  
— You can now export your transactions history to csv files for your reporting need. You can choose to export all transaction or to only export incoming or outgoing transaction.  
— Desktop Notification for Incoming Transfer.  
— Fusion tx to help you optimize your wallet inputs/outputs.  
— WalletShell now have new Night/Dark theme, and is sets as default, you can still easily switch to Light/Green mode if you prefer  
— Realtime node & network status monitoring: it will let you know and pause the sync process whenever the node you’re trying to connect can’t be reach, or when your machine disconnected from network.  
— Utility: PaymentID and Integrated Address generator is there when you need it.

**TurtleCoin Test Suite** — It takes a lot of effort to test all of the RPC calls to TurtleCoind and turtle-service each release. As anyone can tell you, give a lazy man a task and he’ll find an easy way to do it. Given this bit of wisdom, check out turtlecoin-test-suite written in Node.js for quick and simple RPC testing for those of us that want to spend more time coding and less time testing. **— IBurnMyCD**

**TurtleEDU** — For all 62 of you Students out there who enrolled in the beta program at TurtleEDU this week, thank you! For all of you who haven’t, you type **\*student** in the chat and you’ll be given access to the EDU channels and you’ll be part of the Beta testers crew.  
If you’re wondering what TurtleEDU is, here’s the details: _We’re setting up TurtleEDU to help the community become more knowledgeable as users, and help people who want to know about dev stuff have an easy route to being a TRTL dev. If you type \*student you get the student role and access to #edu-general and #edu-help channels. We’re teaching classes of real-world portable skills, but using TurtleCoin as the core example in each lesson, so the first thing you learn how to do when you become a developer is how to interact with our blockchain._ **_— RockSteady_**

**First class goes live for everyone on Dec 9!**

Monkeytips has been around for 4 months now and has steadily increased its followers since conception. Very humble beginnings as just a joke of a coin, monkeytips has become something the community has really rallied behind. Only 250 million max supply, monkeytips is a hot new cryptocoin with a very low total of atomic units having only 2 decimals. We wanted to share the monkeytips love with everyone so recently SoreGums helped code a rainmonkey to rain monkeytips on people in our discord chat! Join up for some fun :) [discord.gg/EAaKcCy](http://discord.gg/EAaKcCy)

**Name of your TRTL fork** — FRED

**Github link for your code** — <https://github.com/fredenrg/FRED>

**What is special or new about your network?**

An increasing population and the industrialization of emerging economies will have a huge impact on future global energy demands and the environment. The FRED Project is aimed at promoting the benefits of alternative energy generation at the consumer level. We believe this will help to reduce the associated environmental impacts of fossil fuel energy generation, and the effects of energy price increases on the consumer due to demand. In addition to promoting consumer energy generation, we are also exploring the possibilities of future alternative and free energy devices. The term “free energy” may sound impossible and some readers may have already run for the hills, but we believe there are devices out there (although not totally free) that have the potential to become mainstream. Why fork TurtleCoin? The reason for choosing TurtleCoin as our base fork was due to the incredible collaboration between the developers and the community. We believe TurtleCoin will be one of the most well developed and feature rich cryptonote coins. We are also looking for contributors of all levels, in all areas of development and promotion.
