## trtl-py on pypi.org

`trtl-py` is a JSON-RPC Wrapper for TurtleCoind and Wallet-API. I've been working on the project since a month, and it's my pleasure to announce that it's ready, and out to be used. Would love reviews, suggestions and feedback on the wrapper. I've spent a good time documenting everything and providing examples of every method. I hope you'll like the project and am looking forward to your views on the wrapper. Have a nice week turtles! :-)

Welcome back IBMCD from his 90 day program, bravely overcoming his battle with Pokemon Go addiction.

## Long time, no update from me. Let’s fix that.

Crazy times we’ve all been in the last few weeks. Disrupted schedules, focus changes, priority shifts, you name it. Personally, my days are filled with video conferences and my nights are oft left wondering what the other side of this fiasco looks like. There’s a lot of uncertainty floating around out there and I wonder where I can use my talents to shape the world around me. New problems require new solutions and there’s more than enough problems to go around.

I, for one, have many pans in the fire and wear many hats to say the least. I’m still working on building out full multisig support for the core software but that takes time and focus that isn’t easy to come by when each day is more mentally draining than the last. Instead, I find myself thinking about different use cases for the technology I’ve learned so much about through this community.

Using the technology as method of funds storage and transfer is a use case that works well. Smart contracts, great, okay, sure. Distributed processing, yeah, I can get behind that. What else can be done with the core technology though? Where can blockchain be used that hasn’t been tapped yet? What real world problems can the technology solve that isn’t ultimately throwing the blockchain buzz word around systems and processes that work just fine how they are? There has to be something more than currency and asset tracking that comes from this.

I’ve been tossing some ideas around the last few weeks, quite often while in the shower. There’s nothing solid in my mind yet but parts of a bigger picture are starting to come together. What that means, I can’t say. It is; however, a chicken and egg scenario. I have to be careful not to create a problem to fit the solution I have forming. To do so, will ultimately lead to its own demise before it even gets off the ground.

Til then, I’ll keep chugging away, working on things that make sense to me given the current world stage by keeping my focus where it matters most and helping those that are in desperate need of guidance. As time permits I’ll get back to churning out updates and code.

There’s plenty to do so if you’d like to lend a hand, speak to and I’m sure that I, or any other contributor, will be more than happy to point you towards ways you can help.

Oh yeah, almost forgot, I pushed a new release of turtlecoin-utils a few weeks ago. Now with full TypeScript support. Check it out :)”
