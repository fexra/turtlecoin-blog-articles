**Today’s value, 10SAT — BTC@10856**

The chat grew from \~600 to over 2736 turtles this week . Morale has been at an all time high, as well as our ticker value, and even our brawlers have stopped arguing about the practicality of tuples in C# code. All around it has been insanely productive, and you all owe yourself a pat on the back and something bubbly.

## Here is a little weekend status update for those of you that are curious what the community did all week:

* TurtleCoin dev ‘Rocksteady’ was interviewed on episode #3 of [**Kevin Rose’s new BlockZero podcast**](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/id1338620184) about the beginnings of the TurtleCoin project. Please subscribe if you like what you hear, and drop Kevin a line in the chat if you want to say thanks!

* **Brian’s TurtleCoin Tshirts** — These were a surprise hit with the community, and I even got one for myself and Mrs. Steady. Check out this link if you want one, and you can even pay with popular cryptoassets.  
**Store —** <https://cryptogifts.store/product/short-sleeve-t-shirt-2/>
* **madk’s Free TurtleCoin Faucet** — One thing that’s been an even bigger hit than the shirts, and something that has saved my fingertips has been madk’s Faucet, where you can fill in a TRTL address, complete a captcha, and get a bunch of free TRTL per day, which is completely community supported. “_Turtlecoin stood out as an impressive and fun project just from the website. The community was very welcoming and I wanted to get involved in the development work. No working faucet had been made at the time, so I tackled it as my project. A faucet is important to any coin’s growth and I’m proud to say that I made turtlecoin’s first._” Without generosity, this community doesn’t function, and without madk’s generosity, we’d have a lot less turtles out there!  
**Faucet —** [**http://faucet.trtl.me**](http://faucet.trtl.me/)
* **TurtleCoin Android —** These guys are building an Android wallet using a programming language that is hot on the Android scene called [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/). I spoke with [**ShAdY**](https://github.com/sslp) in the #dev-mobile chat for this update:  
_“We implemented a basic contact book with a Database(almost done with this, will add search/filtering & backup/restore), QR-Code Features, and an About screen(edited) I’m gonna finish working on the contact book and hopefully we can implement real functionality soon”_  
Developer [**neverdot**](https://github.com/neverdot) also had an update to add, _“UX is coming along nicely, as shady said QR and address book is also working, network stats are functional. Still don’t have the turtle code compiling on mobile but there is a bit more progress._” Outstanding work, guys :)**Github —** <https://github.com/turtlecoin/mobile-kotlin>
* **Block-Explorer** — We held a bounty contest for the block-explorer, which we forked from the Karbowanec project, and the responses were very quick. [The first complete entry was Devopsralf](https://github.com/turtlecoin/block-explorer/pull/2) who claimed the bounty of 1MM TRTL Thanks to all who participated and continue to submit updates: [Turtle0x1](https://github.com/turtle0x1), [islandjim](https://github.com/islandjim), [Watt3r](https://github.com/Watt3r), [Devopsralf](https://github.com/Devopsralf).  
Devopsralf had a few words for the readers, “_I stumbled upon TRTL by sheer luck. I was instantly drawn to its active community and solid development atmosphere. I wanted to create something that would help the project in general and having a need for a block-explorer was the perfect opportunity for me. I really hopes this project succeeds and I cannot wait to see what the future holds for Turtle. Cowabunga!_” Good guy Ralf, thanks man!  
If you’d like to host a block explorer, please contact us to be added to [TurtleTurtle.org](http://turtleturtle.org/)

* **TurtleCoin FAQ —** This one was a much needed labor of love from ZedPea, who took the time to take all of the common setup questions and concerns, plus a concise solution for them and put them into this FAQ for us. This is a fantastic contribution to the project that anybody can contribute.  
**Github —** <https://github.com/turtlecoin/docs/blob/master/FAQ.md>
* **Community Directory** was created; a simple website called [**TurtleTurtle.org**](http://turtleturtle.org/) has links to all community services and projects.
* **desktop-xamarin (Windows GUI Wallet)** — This is a GUI wallet being created by ‘[TheRealCrypt](https://github.com/codingwithredbull)” who goes by the Github username [codingwithredbull](https://github.com/codingwithredbull). This wallet was created using [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin), and is quickly becoming the most visually appealing wallet we have. TheRealCrypt said, “_I could tell TurtleCoin was a unique project from the start, and wanted in on the development right away. All the developers, including myself, have overcome great feats in very short periods, and it shows the nature of how great one project can be when it has a large amazing community behind it. I have had the wonderful pleasure of working on the wallets for TurtleCoin to help users better manage their coins, and I tried not to stop there. I have been working on modifying the current daemon for use on mobile products, and also help with adding ideas to projects to help push PR higher so that all of us my benefit from the amazing community and project that is TurtleCoin._” And we thank you for supporting us, Crypt :)

* **turtle-wallet (Multiplatform GUI Wallet)** — I spoke with CodIsAFish who has been working with Serroft on our Python and Glade multiplatform GUI wallet. Cod said “_Turtle-wallet is currently progressing very nicely, with several pull requests having been made, fixing up a lot of things. We hope to have a bit of a redesign at some point, but our main aim is to get a functional GUI wallet out of the door and working for everyone! Currently we’re just working on a few final things, then the wallet can be tested for a very basic functionality release.”_ Thanks, guys! This wallet is really fun, and is a perfect start for a new developer who wants to tinker with TurtleCoin.

* **turtlecoind-js** — Our very own TurtleCoin core dev Bebop is working on a javascript wrapper for our software that will let us do cool things like web wallets and bots. He had a few things to say “_turtlecoind-js and turtlecoinwallet-js (name may change there) are JavaScript libraries that wrap TurtleCoind daemon and wallet JSON-RPC calls into easy-to-use JavaScript APIs. These libraries will enable the development of JavaScript/HTML applications that depend on interaction with the TurtleCoin blockchain and wallets._” This is a cool idea, and I can’t wait to see how other projects end up using it! Keep going!

* **TurtleCoin v0.3.0 —** This update has contributions from many devs who spotted many typos, inconsistencies, and functions that needed help. One of the biggest improvements was a change of difficulty algorithm to remove some of the incentive for large botnets to swarm our network and spiking the hash rate. This change should take place by block #187,000 automatically as long as you’re running the updated software.  
The source code is up for inspection if you’d like to compile on your own, but if you’re a Windows or Mac user or just don’t have the time, community compiled binaries are on the way. Thanks to nnamon for the git-fu to the rescue!

* **paper-turtle** — This is our cold wallet or paper wallet generator that we use for <https://turtlecoin.lol/wallet> We had an issue where it was supplying a mnemonic and GUI key, even though we don’t have anything to interpret or receive those yet, and there were many tears while that got worked out. The mnemonic and GUI key should have never been on there, and it was put up in such a hurry that we ended up overlooking the fact that it didn’t work in our graphical wallet.
