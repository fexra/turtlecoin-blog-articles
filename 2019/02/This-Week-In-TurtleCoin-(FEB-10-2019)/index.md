TurtleCoin + Alpine + Docker â€” Iâ€™ve managed to get the TurtleCoin binaries to compile on Alpine. There were a couple of issues that were preventing this. The first issue is that ucontext was deprecated in POSIX which musl adheres to. Thankfully someone had created a library that solves the problem. The second issue was that musl has a PAGE\_SIZE macro defined in limits.h that was conflicting with a parameter used on slow-hash.c. This has now been changed to page\_size in the core, resolving the conflict. So far, Iâ€™ve created three images. The first image, which is meant to be a starting point for your own images, builds all the binaries in Alpine then copies them to a scratch container resulting in an image size of 22.6MB. The zedwallet container comes in at 7.96MB and the TurtleCoind image, which includes checkpoints, is only 90MB. I plan to create a series of docker-compose files that will tie them together to help accomplish various tasks. You can view the images on Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/andrewnk/turtlecoin> or on github: <https://github.com/andrewnk/turtlecoin-docker> â€” andrew | trtl.rocks

TRTL.rocks â€” Iâ€™ve made several improvements and changes to the website. I made a silly logic error that caused the initial load time to vary drastically or stall altogether. If the node or pool API is not accessible, then it wonâ€™t be shown on the site. If you donâ€™t see your node or pool in the list, this is most likely the reason. Iâ€™ve cleaned up the line chart, including formatting y-axis and point labels, which should help readability. Iâ€™ve added tooltips to most table headers that describe what the column represents. These can be turned on or off by toggling the Tooltips switch on the bottom right hand of the screen. Finally, Iâ€™ve added the ability to switch the line chart between live and historical data. On initial load, the live mode will be enabled and updates are displayed whenever the data is pushed from the database. Iâ€™m in the process of rewriting iburnâ€™s blockexplorer-cache library to use sequelize, which will help me move on to the block explorer portion of the site. â€” andrewnk | trtl.rocks

## Excelsior

The Celestial community called out.. And the call was answered. We couldnâ€™t save the existing chain, so we re-forked, gave it a new name, and launched Excelsior on Sunday the 3rd of February. All the same network settings the previous dev. gave it, just a new name, logo, and updated codebase.  
If you donâ€™t know Celestial; it was the first coin using the CN Soft Shell algorithm, by TurtleCoin (now with Lite Blocks by Rashed!).
