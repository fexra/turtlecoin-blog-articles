Happy new year! It’s been a great year with you all, and I hope you’ve all made the resolution to mine more TRTL this year, because we’ve got a heck of an update for you! Read more about the upcoming PoW upgrade! 30 days!

# Developer Updates

**TurtlePay™ —** I’m proud to say that the TurtlePay™ Public Beta launch occurred as promised just before Jan 1 2019 00:00:00 GMT. For those of you that have not been following the development of the project, there’s quite a bit of work going on behind the scene to make TurtlePay™ an awesome tool for developers. The service is FREE for everyone to use and the only fee is the standard network transaction fee of 0.10 TRTL.  
TurtlePay™ is a payment processing service that is designed to help developers integrate TurtleCoin™ payments into their existing applications. By providing an easy to use set of tools to incorporate TurtleCoin™ payments into more applications, we hope to drive adoption of the technology to new heights.  
Some people just want to write cool applications and develop new tools that allow them to use the technology without worrying about how it works, why it works, or keeping up with the latest and greatest features. Let us worry about the hard parts while you build awesome applications that use TurtleCoin™.  
We’re looking forward to see what kind of cool things people start to build based on the platform. We’ve already identified a few tweaks to the current system that need to be made given some of the feedback a few people have provided.  
In the next few weeks, I’ll be building out additional documentation on how to leverage the full power of TurtlePay™ and its related tools as well as adding additional features that will only make the platform better.  
The platform is designed with scalability in mind and can easily grow as the needs of community grows. You can even run the platform yourself! Stay tuned for further updates**! — IBurnMyCD**

**Mobile Wallet —** A lot of people have been asking about a mobile wallet, so I thought I’d give it a shot. I’ve got a simple UI running on the phone, simply generating wallets and not much more yet.  
I’m working on building out the main wallet functionality in a separate node package (https://github.com/zpalmtree/turtlecoin-wallet-backend) so it can be used for other things — think web wallets, native GUI wallets that don’t need any of the C++ code, etc. For that reason the repo will be pretty quiet until I’ve got that sorted out. Once the backend is done, it should just be a small matter of hooking it up and making everything look pretty, then off to the races.  
This is going to be a native mobile wallet, so it’s not just a web wallet wrapped in an app. Furthermore, you’ll own your own private keys. This does mean you’ll have to scan the chain, which might be a bit heavy on CPU and battery life, but if you create a new wallet rather than importing, it shouldn’t be too bad. **— Zpalm**

**TurtleCoin RPC Nim** — This is a Nim wrapper for the TurtleCoin RPC APIs. It includes two modules, \`walletd\` for wallet JSON RPC commands and \`turtlecoind\` for the daemon HTTP and JSON RPC methods. There is also a simple example on github showing how to use this package. I have been learning Nim for about a month so let me know if there are any bugs! **— DSanon**

**TurtleCoin-Utils —** I’m happy to report that the TurtleCoin node.js utilities are almost complete. This package is designed to provide native JS (and TypeScript — Thanks Z!) methods and calls that work in Node and in browser to create addresses, decode addresses, scan transactions for funds, create new transactions, and even generate the ring signatures necessary to create a valid transaction on the network. I’ll be working on improving (and in some cases creating) the documentation for the package in the coming days to make the entire package easier to use. **— IBurnMyCD**

**Turtacus —** Turtacus has been rapidly draining funds recently with very few donations coming in to support him. For that reason, I have begun looking at new ways for his prizes to be generated and funded. In coming time, I will be changing the way the tournament works. There will be an entry fee which will only allow those people who have entered, to make it onto the leaderboard. Anyone will be able to fight but only those entered will gain points for the tournament. On top of this, there will be a new points system for the tournament whereby winning will net you 2 points, losing will net you 1 point. In this way, participation is encouraged win or lose. The entry fee is yet to be decided but will likely be between 2500 and 5000 TRTL per person since this is an easy sum to acquire even just from tips during the week. The tournament prize will be 90% of the overall entry fees collected, with the other 10 % going to Turtacus’s prize fund which will be added to an occasional tournament prize pot. As you can tell, there are a lot of changes coming. It will take time but hopefully, it will encourage more fighters. **— Rynem**

**New Turtle-Service API** — To any developers who are currently developing apps with turtle — I would love if you would try out my new API — It’s a replacement for turtle-service, and it gives a bit of a friendlier, REST based interface. If you are having trouble getting it working or have any queries, let me know and I’ll be happy to help. **— zpalm**
