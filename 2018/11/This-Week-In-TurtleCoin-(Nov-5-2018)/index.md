This week we all became game streamers on Twitch Turtle, and rode our time machines back to the 90‚Äôs to see what kind of websites we could build on a floppy! We‚Äôre on track to hit 13,000 users in the Discord chat soon, join us! chat.turtlecoin.lol

# Developer Community Updates

**TwitchTurtle** ‚Äî This week, I tried TwitchTurtle as a streamer. I played ARK Survival for the normal amount of time, and got a few thousand TRTL in tips (if youd like to join Tribe of Turtles, we‚Äôre on ragnarok pvp official 61). In all, it was a fun experience. Streamlabs makes it really easy with their own personal spin on OBS, a popular screencaster program we use to capture the screen. I was up and raining in about 6 or 7 minutes. One thing that‚Äôs cool is that DSAnon is adding in the messaging functionality for custom tip messages into Shellnet so you dont have to set up box turtle on your own to send a tip with a message via the blockchain. There‚Äôs room for improvement, but as a brand new integration, I‚Äôd be skeptical if there weren‚Äôt any wrinkles to smooth out. Watter has done a great job! Very fun! **‚Äî Rock**

**TurtleCities** ‚Äî I had been toying with the idea of making some type of user homepages for our regulars in the chat. I was inspired by webrings of homepages on sites like geocities, angelfire, and expages, those types of sites from the 90‚Äôs. While I didn‚Äôt build an entire frontend for WYSIWYG design, I did create a system that allows me to provision users manually who get a 1.44mb FTP account with no shell access, and a homepage url like <https://pages.turtlecoin.lol/~username.> The account gets created manually, and the user uses something like filezilla to connect via FTP and upload up to 1 floppy of web space. I suppose the next step is some type of shell account or BBS. I‚Äôd like to make it a paid service so you can get the page for free, and then upgrade to a dual density floppy or add shell access down the road. A lot of it is still up in the air waiting for someone to abuse it. I‚Äôd also like to automate account creation, as I‚Äôm currently using a google form and webmin. What‚Äôs cool is that I built a Bash script that generates the main page every 30 seconds server side and updates a list with a bunch of system specs and links to the latest modified pages. **‚Äî Rock**

**TurtlePay‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî I‚Äôve been working the last few weeks hopping between core development and TurtlePay‚Ñ¢. Most of my time there has been spent formulating plans including design documents that are in the repo. As always, slow and steady is the name of the game. I‚Äôve published a draft development roadmap for everyone to take a look at. Feel free to ask questions, provide feedback, or help out. TurtlePay‚Ñ¢ will hopefully build on the foundation of a lot of the tools I‚Äôve already published. It‚Äôs like fitting together a bunch of puzzle pieces that we didn‚Äôt even realize were puzzle pieces :) It‚Äôs definitely an exciting project and I‚Äôm looking forward to what others can build based upon the services the project will offer. **‚Äî IBurnMyCD**

**Krang ‚Äî** Been too busy with work and social the last few weeks. Doing nothing worth mentioning apart from starting mining some Soft-Shell coins and that is looking good, love a good solo mine with no pools, Cant wait to unleash that into the TRTL network. Today I‚Äôm working on adding more customization in Terraform and getting back into the groove of things, probably take a look at turtle.services and ibmcd node.js automation. Getting Schwifty. **‚Äî Slash-atello**

**Walletgreen / turtle-service rewrite ‚Äî** Good progress this week on the rewrite. I got fusion transactions working, which are essentially a standard transaction, but they have a few rules required to allow them to be zero fee. With some help from iburnmycd I implemented a nice algorithm, which should be able to pick the best inputs to optimize together. Pretty much everything on the backend is complete, minus some rare crashes which I‚Äôm still debugging :( I started rewriting zedwallet using the new backend, to help me figure out where stuff is broken or could do with a rework. So far, it‚Äôs nearly complete, and has helped me find nearly all the bugs. \*Hopefully\* we will see it being used in a release after not too long. Since the wallet no longer uses some hacky dispatcher stuff, we can freely do everything on separate threads. With the current implementation, you have to update the wallet sync progress only on the main thread. To work around this, current zedwallet has a pretty ugly method, where it launches a thread to wait for input, and refreshes in the background whilst no input is coming, which is hard to follow, and not very performant. With the rewrite, we just attach to the event handler, and print out the transactions as they come to us, with a simple flag to ensure we‚Äôre not printing in the middle of a command, like transferring. Once everything is polished, this will hopefully make it a lot more trivial to add new features to wallets, with a sane, readable backend. I‚Äôd love to see some more core contributors ‚Äî C++ isn‚Äôt that scary when you get into it! Oh, forget to mention ‚Äî scan height works a lot better now ‚Äî instead of starting at zero, and scanning the blocks below the height ‚Äòquickly‚Äô ‚Äî it just skips those blocks, and starts right at the height you want to scan from. Still haven‚Äôt got around to writing that article on how transactions work‚Ä¶ **‚Äî zpalm**

**TurtleStash** ‚Äî WhassupZA has really been championing this project. Currently there‚Äôs a few kinks to work out, but you can create wallets with seeds and read transactions as they come in, but there‚Äôs a weird timeout issue when you try to send them. This should work itself out soon, and it‚Äôs really cool to see the progress. Plenteum and Masari team have done the entire project conversion for TRTL and it‚Äôs been great watching things come together. Just a reminder, TurtleStash is a website running the clientless web wallet forked from Masari. This is important because it is a webwallet that allows the user to own their own keys and not depend on a third party to run the software. **‚Äî rock**
