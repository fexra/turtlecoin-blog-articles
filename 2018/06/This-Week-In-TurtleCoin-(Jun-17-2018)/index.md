# And now for this week’s updates…

Zedwallet \[Pictured Above\] —Zedwallet is a new CLI wallet that replaces Simplewallet in TurtleCoin, and really any Cryptonote coin with very few modifications. In this wallet we have in-wallet fusions, transaction splitting, and an improved user experience. We recently did an in-depth article detailing the work that went into the new wallet with the creator himself.

TurtleNode.IO Block Explorer — htps://blocks.tutlenode.io

**TurtleNode.IO Remote Daemon & Explorer —“**_I’ve spent this week working on speeding the TurtleNode.io block explorer. Considerable effort has been put forth to create a lightning fast block explorer with full historical capabilities that is driven by fast cache mechanisms and other performance enhancements. Additional enhancements are being worked on that will make the service even faster. Check it out at_ [_https://blocks.turtlenode.io_](https://blocks.turtlenode.io/)_. In other news, I’ve rebuilt all of the load balances for the public nodes and as a result, direct access to each of the nodes is no longer supported. Please make sure that you’re using one of the region based hostnames as listed on_ [_https://turtlenode.io_](https://turtlenode.io/) _or simply public.turtlenode.io_” **— iburnmycd**

**Difficulty Algorithm —**_“After about a month of testing, and tweaking, the LWMA-2 difficulty algorithm is ready to go! It’s been merged into the main codebase, and will go live at an appropriate block height once the next release is made. This should reduce the profitability of pulse mining, prevent timewarp attacks from freezing the network, and make the difficulty just a lot more reactive. Thanks to zawy for his work on this and SoreGums for running all the testnet infrastructure!”_ **— ZpalmTree**

a rare peak at Fexra’s TurtleWallet Web Wallet backend, rumored to be engineered by magical elves formerly employed by Elon’s personal moles at CERN.

**Fexra’s TurtleWallet Web Wallet —**_“ After more than two weeks of sweat and tears and lots of help from all the good turtle devs, I finally finished converting all the workers that read incoming and outgoing transactions to a much more efficient and stable system. I want to thank all of you for being so patient and giving it another try! If you haven’t yet, come and join us at_ [_https://chat.turtlewallet.io_](https://chat.turtlewallet.io/)_”_ **— Fexra**

Box-Turtle, A host your own at home web wallet for people who don’t trust or need an online hosted web wallet.

**Box-Turtle Host Your Own Web Wallet —**”_The goal here was to get a little web wallet you can run locally on a Raspberry Pi at home. We ran into some snags with getting our code compiling on a Raspberry Pi, and in fact there’s a bounty of over 1MM TRTL to get the code compiling on a Pi, just because we think it’s that cool of a project. In the mean time, however, we are working to turn it into a self contained VirtualBox appliance you can host at home. Eventually, we want to be able to make a bunch of these Turtle-Pi’s and bring them to weekend hackathons in youth communities to get new users acquainted with TRTL and some light blockchain related development with a low target cost and high potential for usability. Community buy in is important to fulfill our mission to educate those that aren’t already crypto-savvy.”_ **_— RockSteady_**

**Gladiator Bot —** _“Gladiator introduced weekly tournaments last Sunday with the top Gladiator being awarded 10,000TRTL at the following Sunday. This week, potions have been introduced! You can now purchase potions from Gbot at 150 TRTL each for recovering 20hp for use in battles. This should help keep Gladiator Bot funded and able to continue offering the prizes he offers! Next stage is stats!”_ **_—_ Rynem**
