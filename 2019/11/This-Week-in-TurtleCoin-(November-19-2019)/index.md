## Developer Updates

This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL project they’re working on. It’s a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we’re happy to see them all and it shows that we’re an active community.

**CantiLib / CS-TurtleCoin**

Another overdue update. I set aside a day to write up everything that goes on while talking to and syncing with an existing node, getting back to my reverse-engineering roots. Since then, I’ve been working on implementing these communications into CantiLib. This mean that soon™ a CS-TurtleCoin node will be able to act as a functional peer on the network, able to relay and propogate data to and from other nodes. I have also moved to utilize EF Core 3.0 for local data storage, and have rewritten block caching to suit, which means that a user will be able to choose which database type they’d like to use to store their synced data. At the moment, I have implementations for SQLite, MSSQL, Azure Cosmos, among others. Once these changes are completed and pushed, there will still be a _lot_ left to add to get it to the same level as an existing C++ node, such as fleshing out API functions, but it’ll be a big step forward in my daemon rewrite.

**Proton Wallet — Halloween Release!**

“Hey guys, Extra here, the new version of Proton wallet is going to be coming out on Halloween, 10/31 and it has some features I’m very excited about. We’ve implemented a brand new address feature and a search feature, which should make it easier to send transactions and navigate through the wallet. The search feature is pretty nifty; you can search transaction hashes, contact details in your address book, or even for settings you’d like to change, and it will return any results to you in a nicely formatted list. In addition, I’ve found and squashed a few more bugs that result in faster syncing when minimized, and an overall better user experience.

You can grab the newest release at the link below, and please let me know what you think or if you have any feature requests for Proton!

For next month’s release, I’m going to be focusing on adding deterministic subwallet support. This means you’ll be able to generate as many new addresses as you’d like and use them, and be able to restore them all with a single seed. It’’s a feature I’ve wanted to see in a TurtleCoin wallet for a while.

Thanks everybody and stay cool! BD”

**TonChan**

“On Wednesday the 14th I finally put out an update to TonChan, for 10% of users. If there are no errors discovered then I’ll deploy it to everyone shortly. This update has some big fixes, the major one being a fix where your wallet received a ton of transactions, and you were on Android 9, you may have been unable to open your wallet.

This is caused by only being able to read 1MB of data at once from a single row in the database. This is fixed by just chunking the wallet in the database, and hopefully retroactively fixed by those who have too large wallets by performing chunked reads.

Another big feature is the ability to swap nodes. Now if there’s ever maintenance on the blockchain cache, you’ll still be able to sync your wallet. Furthermore, you can choose a node which is closer to you geographically or potentially under lower load for improved sync speeds.

Finally, I made some tweaks to ensure that the UI is always snappy whether your node is having issues connecting or not.

I’ll not bore you with every single little change made, if you’re interested in that then you can check out the full changelog here: <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-mobile-wallet/releases/tag/v1.0.1>

Let me know if you’re having any issues with the new update. Hope you like it.”

**GitHub Actions CI/CD**

GitHub has finally released its own CI/CD with some amazing specs. So I decided to try it out and move the entire CI pipeline of TurtleCoin from travis and appveyor to GitHub Actions. This week I have tested the new caching feature to reduce build times significantly. I have also created a PR to use the artifacts produced in these builds for releases and testing purposes..

**Low Orbit Turtle Cannon**

Use wallet API to create N wallets, spread some turtlecoins between them, and then spam the transaction pool with pointless transactions between them nodes. Great way to stress test _cough_ DDOS _cough_ your network!? Just a hackathon though, if someone wants to think about it. It could be a bit naughty, sir. Just posting these so you can collect hackathon ideas for people to discuss and use.

It’s what happens when two turtles meet under the covers of a blockchain transaction ❤. They spawn new extra special turtles, only for you my friend! They are not turtlecoins but rather virtual turtles, in the spirit of cryptokitties and titties. I could write how it could work here, but the margin is too narrow to contain it. Therefor, just do it your way!?

## **Extra’s Reporter Articles**

Hey everybody, Extra here, reporting on some of the goings on I’ve seen in the past week.

## New Reporter Role

We’ve been having some issues getting enough submissions for the roundup, so we decided to switch up the way we do things a little bit. We came to the conclusion that lots of stuff worth talking about was getting done each week; but these folks weren’t to keen on writing up a few sentences for our blog. So, we created the reporter role on discord. Zpalm, ibmcd and I, and perhaps a few others I am not aware of, will be writing up short reports on cool goings-on we see down in #dev-general and other areas when we see them. This is an attempt to get some more content into the writeup, and also perhaps encourage the authors of these cool projects to come forward and write little bit about them to the community so that all of you guys knopw what is going on. With that being said, here are some of the cool things I’ve seen in the last week or so…

## Mysterious Third Party Wallet Integration

A new face has appeared down in #dev-general asking some techie questions. His name is @zhang, so if you see him around be sure to give a turtley “”hello.”” He’s been working with the turtlecoin-wallet-backend-js on a mysterious-sounding project. We reached out to zhang for comment, and he informed us that he was working on integrating TurtleCoin with his third party wallet application. That sure sounds interesting to me, and we are looking forward to seeing what happens with it! Welcome zhang to the community and good luck with the integration!

It is a pleasure to add turtle to HebeWallet, the first purely anonymous coin for Hebe Wallet.  
We got a lot of help from the turtle community in integrating Turtle in the wallet. Most communities ignore third party development, but we were able to get alot of questions answered very quickly. This saved us alot of time. We will release it in the next version.

## New Test for the JSON Node List

Ibmcd has been hard at work as usual, and he has a certain talent for setting up cool CI testing. For those that don’t know, we run a list of turtlecoin public nodes on github that other applications can use in order to find active TurtleCoin full nodes for their users here: <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-nodes-json> Up until now, maintainers of that repository have had to manually check to see if a node is online: However, no longer is that the case. IBMCD has written a fully automated check that happens with Travis and will ensure your node is reachable from the internet directly in the CI testing. If you say, open a PR with a dead node, the CI test will fail and you will be automatically notified on the pull request page on github. That’s really neat! Nice job IBMCD. :muscle: :triumph:

## Aneki’s Bootstrap

Aneki has recently updated his bootstrap of the TurtleCoin blockchain for those of you with slow CPUs who want an easy way to get synced. As always, you can find the updated bootstrap at the link below:

## Moving Up!

It’s always good to be recognized! These are the people who gained new roles in the community this week!

![](./images/0qufUVzyRaMjHNU60.gif)

This week we added two new reporters to a new role called… you guessed it, Reporter! The reporter’s role is to write down cool things that happen during the week that would otherwise not make it into the roundup. Pitch them a few TRTL if you see them being helpful!

Also big thanks to Spookypool who’s starting up a new TurtleCoin pool, we thank you! Best of luck!

**Reporter**: ExtraHash, Zpalmtree
