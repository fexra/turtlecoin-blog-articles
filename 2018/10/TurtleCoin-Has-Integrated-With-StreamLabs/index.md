# TurtleCoin Has Integrated With StreamLabs!

## I’ve been teasing at this announcement for a few weeks now on Twitter, and I’ve heard guesses all over the place for what it could be. Finally I can give you guys the news about a TurtleCoin feature that nobody else in our space has yet. Starting today, you can one click enable TRTL crypto tips on your Twitch.tv streams and start taking money immediately! I was so excited about this news for you guys that I wanted to interview the creator himself, Watter. I know you guys will enjoy this one :)

Watter, Thanks again for agreeing to this, I know you’re really busy. I wanted to get an interview with you to announce TwitchTurtle. I’m sure a lot of people would like to know about a TurtleCoin integration with StreamLabs for Twitch streamers. I think creators will really appreciate being able to take tips in TurtleCoin, and likewise I think their viewers and patrons will be a lot more likely to send TRTL since it’s so easy to mine and send to your friends. If you don’t mind, tell us a little bit about how you got the idea for TwitchTurtle, and how long did it take to get to where you are now?

## Watter

Thank you rock for inviting me to this interview, it’s my pleasure to be here. TwitchTurtle is a new payment integration with StreamLabs, it provides a simple way for Twitch and Youtube streamers to receive donations fast, securely, and without the fear of fake donations. I got the idea of making TwitchTurtle when I was watching a streamer, and I wanted to donate to him in TurtleCoin. The first version of this project was clunky and required the Streamer to download a program to get it working, now with the new and improved version, you just sign in with StreamLabs, and it does the rest of the work for you! This project has been in development for a while now, the first Git commit was Aug 3\. I wanted to get it right, and so I went through every line of code with my helpful co-worker, @Chris Crypto. Now, we’re ready to accept tips at <https://twitchturtle.com/>.

I know with Twitch or with YouTube, when someone tips you, usually if it’s a real tip you get that money at the end of the month. How long does it take on TwitchTurtle from the moment someone is tipped to the moment they can spend their TRTL?

## Watter

One of the advantages of using the TurtleCoin blockchain to donate is the overall speed. Tips show up on stream faster, you can withdraw tips into your personal balance _instantly_, and for your viewers, it’s fast to set up. With TwitchTurtle, you have control over your funds. You don’t have to worry about chargebacks, or chargeback fees, all TwitchTurtle donations are final. Fake donations are a thing of the past with TwitchTurtle, before they show up on stream, tips are confirmed through the TurtleCoin blockchain so whenever an alert shows up, you know its legit.

So walk me through step by step with a quick short bullet list how easy it is for the Twitch streamers reading this article to get started with TwitchTurtle. Where do we start?

Setting up TwitchTurtle is designed to be simple and painless. All you have to do is go to <http://new.twitchturtle.com/> and it will create an account linked with your StreamLabs account. Now your new account is setup! All you have to do is share the “public address” to your viewers and they can start donating. If you want, you can also add some info about what TurtleCoin is and send your viewers to <https://convert.twitchturtle.com/> for them to add messages to their donations! If you have any questions about the setup process, come on by the discord help server at <http://chat.twitchturtle.com/>. In that server there is also free advertising, so you can get more TwitchTurtle followers and grow your fanbase!

That’s pretty cool, it sounds like there’s not much keeping someone from accepting crypto tips on Twitch now. If you could get any streamer to use your service, who would it be?

# Watter

You! The person who is reading this, We want you to start streaming with TwitchTurtle! Anyone can make an account, and start streaming in the next 5 seconds and receive tips.

I think that about covers it, is there anything else you want to say?

# Watter

Yes! Theres so many people in my life I would like to thank my TwitchTurtle supporters, who have been patiently waiting for this release for about 3 months now, so huge shout out to them for believing in me! I would also like to thank the first streamers who used TwitchTurtle, Yoma97, Sajo8, and CryptoDota, thanks for being early adopters! I also am partnered with turtlenode.online, a fast TurtleCoin node which powers TwitchTurtle. I want to thank you rock, for inviting me to this interview, and to the entire TurtleCoin community for the support. You guys rock!

**Also, I just wanted to say it really means a lot to be the one of the youngest people interviewed on TurtleCoin, I learned so much from this project and will never forget any of the countless people in this discord as I move onward in life.**
