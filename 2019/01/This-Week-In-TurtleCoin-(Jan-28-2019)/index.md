**XMRig** — Hey, Wixer here. I just wanted to let you guys know that xmrig as well as xmrig-amd and xmrig-nvidia have received an update. CryptoNight Turtle is now officially supported!  
<https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases>  
<https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-amd/releases> <https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-nvidia/releases>  
Huge thanks to Github users: lost-bro, fexra, brandonlehmann, davehlong, YetAnotherRussian, SChernykh, Bendr0id and of course xmrig who worked on making this happen! So far I’ve only tested xmrig-amd for a few days and it runs very stable. The hash rate for my rig has increased by 3.7 times. If you’re curious of how your hardware will perform after the upcoming fork, you can simply download or build the right miner for your system. There already is a CryptoNight Turtle coin you can mine to test xmrig. It’s called DeroGold and it’s a lot of fun to mine because of the high supply. So why don’t you update your miner, so that you’ll only have to change algorithm when it’s fork time? **— Wixer**

# Community Advertisements

Motivated by the recent dramatic increases in network difficulty, we’re testing out a new feature at our predictable solo mining pool that lets multiple users “mine as one” for faster payouts. Simply specify “pprop” in the password field of your miner config to join the mining collective. Come on by, check out the whitepaper on this new payment scheme, and jump on in — the water’s warm!
