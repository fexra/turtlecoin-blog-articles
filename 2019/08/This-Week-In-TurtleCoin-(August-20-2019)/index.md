Proton Wallet

**Proton Wallet**

Hey guys, I’ve just released the newest version of Proton Wallet, my wallet client for TurtleCoin. As always, you can download it at the link below. This wallet rewrites a ton of the logic powering the wallet and makes the entire thing leaner, meaner, and more modular. There’s also a few new features: closing to tray being toggleable in settings, a lock button in the navbar, as well as an auto-lock feature which locks your wallet with a password after 15 minutes of inactivity. Check out the changelog on the releases page for more details (and download the latest release!) Hope you guys are enjoying the wallet

TurtlePay

**TurtlePay**

After much consideration, I’m working on adding the ability for developers to supply their own view key and address when creating a new payment request. In doing so, TurtlePay will continue to monitor the TurtleCoin blockchain for incoming funds and fire alerts as it does now; however, it will never actually have access to the funds as the user will send funds directly to the specified wallet. This provides another avenue for payment processing that other projects do not have.

violetminer

**violetminer**

My miner has come a long way since the last roundup post. It is fully functional now, and has had lots of optimizations implemented for the different intrinsics available on different x86–64 CPUs. From my tests, it hashes just as well as trtlrig or better!

Today I’m working on adding some ARM optimizations, which I think trtlrig doesn’t have yet, so make sure to check out the hashrate after I get those in if you’re an SBC fan :)

Aside from the hashing speed improvements, there were lots of improvements to how the miner communicates with the pool. Still lots more to make the miner easier to use though, I need to improve the hashrate reporting, and add some interactive commands. Hopefully I can get that done before the fork date arrives!

Moving on up! Thanks to all the community members who took new roles in the community this week!

## Moving Up!

Great job, y’all!

## Good First Issues

Good First Issues are tickets that are marked as ‘easy wins’ for new developers. If you want to be a TurtleCoin Developer, these are great tasks to start with!

* **Use matches property in ApiDispatcher regex #862**  
Some calls in the [ApiDispatcher](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/blob/development/src/walletapi/ApiDispatcher.cpp) use a regex, for example, `getTransactionDetails`. They then extract the query parameters. We could instead extract `hashStr` using the `matches` property on the `req` object, by adding a capture group to the hash regex.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/862>
* **Remove no longer relevant asserts #811**  
Since pretty much everyone runs the daemon in release mode, instead of debug mode, we’ve ended up where we have a number of asserts which constantly trigger, due to altered/moved/rewritten sections of code.  
<https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/issues/811>
* **Daemon+WalletBackend timestamp adjustments #704**  
The current /getwalletsyncdata rounds a timestamp to midnight. Depending on what time of the day you start a fresh wallet, you may have no blocks to grab (we need to roll back a bit more than we currently do with the timestamp adjustment), or too many (since it’s rounding to midnight which is quite far away).

* Hi Guys, it is with great regret that I announce that the turtlepool.space mining pool will be closing. I have been here since day one, and it’s been fantastic to see the community grow and develop from 20 people meming, and network forks every hour, to the 15,000 members there are now. I will still keep other services I run going, such as the tag/star discord bot, and my public node. For more details, please see the attached link. <http://turtlepool.space/pool_closure.html>
* I used to have one of the higher fees, not anymore muahaha! Still going, even better uptime thanks to the crew here! [http://turtle.japakar.com](http://turtle.japakar.com/)
* List of nodes and pools! <https://trtl.nodes.pub/>
