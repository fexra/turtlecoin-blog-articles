# Developer Community

**turtle-completo** — I have rewritten the local turtle explorer using python and kivy frame work. Initially I just wanted to find a good GUI framework to make a turtle wallet, then I was looking into kivy for its crossplatform feature. So I thought I could move the local explorer to kivy first, then start developing the turtle wallet that I wanted to add on to the local explorer. The turtle-completo project looks better and it is more dynamic in terms of searching behavior, and it is faster than the previous local turtle explorer, though I know there is still a lot room for improvement. (I admit my code is a bit messy, and I probably forgot to remove some unused lines, I will get back to that later and clean it up) The turtle wallet is still under development. If anyone that wants to join the party and make a “project completo” with me, just DM me on discord. Also, if you are developing or interested in developing a mobile version turtle wallet, please let me know, I would like to work together. **— Sabo (Revolutionary)**

**turtlecoin-rpc-go —** 2 weeks back I posted about the major restructure that this library (turtlecoin-rpc-go) got and I told about the documentation thing. Here we are today, in this timespan I have tested every RPC call using the library and documented those at [https://api-docs.turtlecoin.lol](https://api-docs.turtlecoin.lol/) . The library also got some error handling as promised. It is up to date with the latest dev branch of the network. I will be working on adding more error/exception handling, making it more reliable (which it is by the way), and follow the Go standard conventions. I am looking forward towards the community to integrate this library in their projects. **— rashedmyt**

**GUI Node** — I got the gui node working with the help of Z and ibmcd. The purpose of the GUI node is that home users need to be able to run public nodes on their home computers to avoid centralization with AWS and other cloud providers. A simple port forward is all you need. The chain is getting big enough to where it makes sense to run on home hardware rather than a hosted server. Currently you can start the daemon and define a price and fee wallet. The roadblock I’m having is kind of stupid. I’m trying to assign the value of the fee when entered to the QProcess parameter. It sounds really simple but I’m just dumb when it comes to Qt. -Rock

**Web Wallet —** Now that we’re at a point on our fork that we can release, we’re shifting focus back to the web wallet. In progress at the moment is the ability for the webwallet to connect directly to a node (private node). The first step of this is to create some new RPC calls in the daemon to allow the web wallet to retreive transactions directly (thanks @ZPalmTree who’s already done some work on this), this involves some optimisation and stripping of data we don’t need and then we will update the web-wallet’s RPC calls to go direct to node so we can drop the background caching process in the web wallet. The final challenge with this is to ensure that the web-wallet, on an HTTPS interface can connect directly to the node on an HTTP interface. -**WhassupZA | Plenteum**
