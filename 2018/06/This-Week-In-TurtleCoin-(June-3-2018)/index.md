# This Week In TurtleCoin (June 3, 2018)

## We passed 500,000 blocks this week, and learned that pinging 11,000 chat users is the quickest way to get to 10,000 chat users!

**Gladiator Bot —**_“Gladiator Bot is now in full swing! He has a fully functional leveling system where turtles can fight to the death and earn experience to level up! At present, levels provide you with bragging rights. As time goes on, that will change. More importantly, wins and losses are now being tracked and can be displayed per user by typing \*level in the colosseum! Gladiator Bot now also has his own wallet set up which in the coming days will be incorporated into his code to allow fight prizes to be won! The leaderboard code is coming together nicely and this could also spell the beginning of weekly tournaments! For my first JS project, there have obviously been hiccups and times when the bot has crashed but I thank you all for being patient with me as I fix these bugs and thank you still for pointing these bugs out to me! As always, I’m happy to receive suggestions for the bot and am taking them all on board.”_ **— Rynem**

**walletd-ha & turtlecoind-ha —** _“I’ve been a VERY busy bee this week. turtlecoind-ha received massive updates this week including websockets via socket.io, New project walletd-ha designed in the same manner as turtlecoind-ha with high-availability in mind including a full API wrapper and websocket goodness via socket.io. Events that make development of applications around walletd VERY easy.”_**— iburnmycd**
