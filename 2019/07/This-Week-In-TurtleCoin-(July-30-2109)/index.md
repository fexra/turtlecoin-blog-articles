**Public Node**

Sorry I have messed up setting up the server for the node, and I had to start over again with the server droplet. This is the new node IP: [174.138.29.231:11898](http://174.138.29.231:11898/), feel free to connect to it.

Merchandise Bot

**Merchandise Bot**

Hi :) My name is fipsi and I’ve been working on the Merchandise Bot together with @DroppingThePacketsHard2 and @Elkim for the last 2 weeks. The Merchandise Bot can automatically list your items with a title, description and a TRTL price. If you want the bot to auto-update the price of your item, send him a DM with title, description and a fiat price (no market-talk in the Discord). The bot is being hosted by @DroppingThePacketsHard2.  
@Mr. Lahaye discovered an issue with the maximum pinned message count, which limits the amount of pinned messages to 50 per channel..  
So if you have old items in the pinned list (#merchandise) please unpin them and if they’re still relevant, please re-list them using the Merchandise Bot.  
Thank you all for the positive feedback and the great community :t\_heart:  
See you in the discord, fipsi :)

Nest is back :)

**TurtleCoin’s Nest GUI has been REBORN!**

For all those that have experienced TurtleCoin may have been, or even still, using TurtleCoin’s Nest GUI at one point. After some updates to TurtleCoin’s code, the History section of the GUI seized to work and it was unclear why. A few month’s ago, I posted about forking Nest into a new GUI because I had noticed that every fork of Nest is the exact same but with a different ticker and decimals. So this was my personal mission, to this day I’m still working on it, forking Nest into something new and then IBMCD (IBurnMyCD) had noted to me that the History section didn’t work and I replied that I hadn’t noticed and I will take a look at it. Earlier, whilst syncing my wallet with Nest, I did notice my balance changing but no transactions was getting listed. I did manage to come up with a fix for this, which would fix the whole of the history section. It was funny in a way because I got to build upon my original PR.  
_can you tell I’m proud of this with how much I’m chatting on_  
Anyway, long story short, TurtleCoin’s Nest GUI is fully functional again and it works with TurtleCoin’s latest binaries so you can go back to enjoying Nest again! I will be making more useful PR’s to Nest and _I’ll try and convince Rock to upload my GUI when it’s ready._

Teacup, and the quest to git gud

**turtlecoin/teacup**

Hey! So I did something I never thought I would do — my first commit on GitHub! I added just about every TurtleCoin image I’ve created so far to the “”teacup”” repository. Feel free to share them or use them any way you like! It’s a sheer pleasure for me coming up with these pictures and I’m inspired to create many more, among other TRTL things…  
Thank you all for such positive feedback. I’m happy to be a part of this with all of you!

## Good First Issues

_Good First Issues are tickets that are marked as ‘easy wins’ for new developers. If you want to be a TurtleCoin Developer, these are great tasks to start with!_

**Remove no longer relevant asserts #811**

Since pretty much everyone runs the daemon in release mode, instead of debug mode, we’ve ended up where we have a number of asserts which constantly trigger, due to altered/moved/rewritten sections of code.

We probably want to remove or update all these asserts to ensure they are still indeed checking things which should be ‘impossible’.

It would also be nice to add more assertions to new code.

I’m not aware how many asserts there are in the current codebase, but it would probably be a good idea to separate this into multiple PR’s for ease of reviewing and testing.

**Daemon+WalletBackend timestamp adjustments #704**

The current /getwalletsyncdata rounds a timestamp to midnight. Depending on what time of the day you start a fresh wallet, you may have no blocks to grab (we need to roll back a bit more than we currently do with the timestamp adjustment), or too many (since it’s rounding to midnight which is quite far away).

We should instead just respect the timestamp given, and have a better adjust so we always sync about 100 or so blocks to be safe.

Might require a bit of work, since the timestamp fetching routines I believe hit the two DB caches, which aren’t the most fun to work with.
