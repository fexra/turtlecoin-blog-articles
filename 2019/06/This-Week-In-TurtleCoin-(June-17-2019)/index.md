## Developer Updates

_In this issue we all post shocked pikachu emojis when people forget to upgrade their miners for Chukwa and we mine all the TRTLs without them ;)_

**Rotate Discord Server Invite Backgrounds**

Discord’s new Nitro Boost stuff allows for Discord owners to choose custom background images when people use the invite links. However it means people have to manually click buttons in the Discord app.

So please head over to <https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360047859252-Add-API-endpoint-for-server-invite-background> and upvote this post to encourage the Discord developers to expose this feature in the Official API. **SoreGums**

**TurtleCoin Github Bot**

I’ve been looking into supporting multiple people making an issue at once with the Github bot; it doesn’t seem like it’ll be too hard to add, and it’ll be a nice little perk. If you don’t know what the Github bot is, I recommend you check it out! It lets you easily create a Github issue on any turtlecoin repo w/out an acc; type `!tag issue` in the `#bots` channel to learn more

**turtlecoin-crypto**

As mentioned last week, I’ve been working on combining the different versions of this repo together. Good news! It’s done.

This repo now builds the following:

1) A c++ static library (Windows, Linux, OSX)  
2) A shared library via DLL (Windows) that can be linked against in any number of languages (C# anyone? — @canti, I see you)  
3) Node.js native addon module (same as the NPM package before)  
4) Native Javascript implementation (slow, very slow, but it works)  
5) WASM module for browser use (much, much, much faster than the Native JS in browser)

All of the builds support the core crypto used not only in wallet functions (creating keys, finding our outputs, generating ring signatures, etc) but they also contain all of the hash functions available in core, including Chukwa (Argon2id with our parameters). The WASM module makes it very easy to bring the crypto methods used in TurtleCoin to the browser which will make client-side web wallets faster than ever\*. In addition, if someone wanted to build a web miner based on the package they can do so.

_Spoiler alert: Someone is building a client-side web wallet built on this using wallet-backend-js._

**turtlecoin-utils**

Using the updates to the turtlecoin-crypto library, I’ve performed a few updates on the development branch of turtlecoin-utils. Most notably, the utils package now smart loads the crypto module. If we can load the Node native addon module, that’s always our first choice. If we’re in browser, then we try to load the WASM first. Lastly, if all else fails, we fall back to the native Javascript implementation. This also has the added benefit of cleaning up a bit of the code that revolves around the crypto in the library.

In addition, due to the exposure of all of the crypto functions in the library now, we’re able to check that the ring signatures that are generated via the library are checked to be valid upon creation thereby reducing the chance of generating an invalid transaction via the library.

If that wasn’t enough, I’ve added a webpack configuration to the project that ties everything up into a nice bundle for inclusion for browser use. Browser use did you say? You betcha. This webpack has been deployed as part of the TurtleCoin Explorer and is used for the tools page (playing with wallet addresses & keys) and the transaction checker. It’s going to make that top secret client-side web wallet shine.”

**CS-TurtleCoin**

Over the last week, I have done a lot on the CS-TurtleCoin/CantiLib project. I pushed some major updates, including a full rewrite of the main repo, which features improvements across the board. As I have been fairly silent with the project lately, I’m going to give a quick run-down of what it is and what I have gotten done thus far.

CantiLib is a multi-purpose C# library with many useful tools for a blockchain environment, including a standalone P2P client system, a configurable REST API server, logging utilities, database functionality, cryptography, byte-level serialization, and CryptoNote protocol handling. CS-TurtleCoin is an effort to tie these tools together to create a fully operational TurtleCoin node, coded from the ground up in a C#.

As of the time of writing this, I have P2P connectivity, API handling, CryptoNote deserialization, peer discovery and handshaking, some database functionality, the start of a blockchain cache, and a number of other utilities and functions in place. Lately, my focus has been on refining peer discovery between nodes, porting cryptographic functions from the core code to C#, connecting TurtleCoin-Crypto to the library, adding more functionality and ease of use to the API server, and have also begun work on the sync process and blockchain caching. More to come soon!

**wallet-api-go**

**wallet-api-go**

This project aims to provide a wrapper for making wallet-api requests with Go. All of the wallet-api responses are marshaled into an appropriate type. You no longer have to manually convert from `map[string]interface{}`!

If there’s any bugs in the codebase, feel free to leave an issue on GitHub. :D

**TurtleCoin Chukwa Cuvée Testnet available**

As everything is in full swing to get ready for the Argon2id-based new TurtleCoin algo called chukwa, we needed to spin up a local testnet.

This allows us to benchmark, test and optimize our different boards, and see how the trtlrig works compared to the native TurtleCoin miner.

We made our test environment available. If you want to see how your harware will do on the new algo, and try out how it feels living on the cutting-edge technology, build your trtlrig from the add\_chuwka branch available in the TurtleCoin github, and point your xmrig miner using the following parameters:

`-o publicnode.ydns.eu:42333`  
`-a chukwa`  
`-u your TRTL address`

Please note no web front-end available, and no TurtleTestCoin pay-outs. This environment is for benchmark tests only.

**Wallet format upgrading**

A few people have requested that there be a utility to upgrade a wallet from the WalletGreen format (zedwallet, turtle-service), to the WalletBackend format (zedwallet-beta, wallet-api).

I’ve been working on this for the past few days, and think I am close to completion. Got a few bugs with transfer amounts being incorrect, but hopefully it won’t be a sticking point.

I’m considering adding an automatic upgrade, so you can transparently open an old format wallet and have it upgraded without any user interaction. One downside is that we have to generate the key image for each input when we upgrade the format, which is pretty slow for a large wallet — this can take around 10–20 seconds on my \~8000 transaction wallet.

Of course, this will only have to be done once, so the delay could be worth it.  
Hopefully this will make it easier for services to migrate to wallet-api, along with new GUI’s/CLI’s using the new backend.

## Rig Of The Week

Each week we like to highlight a person who has sent in pics and descriptions of their TRTL mining rigs. This week is ZenMaster Mr Lahaye’s turn! Ironically, it was his idea to start this column about rig of the week so maybe he had this planned all along! hmmm!
