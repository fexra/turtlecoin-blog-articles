**Zpalmtree‚Äôs ‚Äú_How To Fork TurtleCoin‚Äù_ Tutorial ‚Äî** ‚Äú_I had a really fun time this weekend live-blogging the process of making my own altcoin forked from TurtleCoin with Zpalmtree‚Äôs new guide for how to fork TurtleCoin properly._

_A lot of aspiring devs were forking TurtleCoin and afraid to ask for help or making rookie mistakes like removing licenses from the source code, so we decided to help the community by making a step by step guide with all of the parameters laid out with notes and details. Making an altcoin can be frustrating for some and we want to make it easier for others to have the same chances we had when making a new network._

_Check out my article about the whole process, and mine a few blocks of ‚ÄúAthena‚Äù my new slow settlement-layer blockchain with 1 hour blocks! I‚Äôm thinking I might keep this one around for later just in case.._‚Äù ‚Äî RockSteady

Integrated Addresses!

**Integrated Addresses ‚Äî** ‚Äú_This week I‚Äôve added integrated addresses to both walletd and zedwallet. (Coming to your favourite GUI soon‚Ñ¢) You can start using them now if you build from source, or wait for 0.6.4‚Ä¶_ 
_You might be wondering what an integrated address is. In short, it‚Äôs a standard TRTL address, and a payment ID squished together. Here I‚Äôm using it to send to my tipjar without providing a payment ID:_ <https://i.imgur.com/pJQFbGX.png> _\[That‚Äôs a big address, for you\]_ 
_Why is this handy? Well, it means an exchange, or other service which requires payment ID‚Äôs to transact can simply send you an integrated address instead of an address and payment ID pair. This integrated address is then parsed by your wallet into an address and payment ID pair internally, and sent as a normal transaction. This means you no longer have to worry about using the wrong payment ID or forgetting it. If you‚Äôve used Monero derived coins, then you might have used one before. Monero‚Äôs block template allows 16 char payment IDs, so their integrated addresses are a lot shorter, at about 115 characters. TurtleCoin integrated addresses are a whopping 236 characters! If you‚Äôre an RPC API maintainer, you might want to consider adding the createIntegratedAddress() method to your API so users can easily create integrated addresses to supply to people ‚Äî more info here:_ <https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/pull/337> _Right now there‚Äôs not really anything supporting integrated addresses, but hopefully soon exchanges and other services will adopt them. The tipjar could support them too! You can manually create integrated addresses in zedwallet to mess around with by using the_ `_makeintegratedaddress_` _command._‚Äù **‚Äî Zpalmtree**

Turtacus

**Gladiator Bot (Turtacus) ‚Äî** ‚Äú_Turtacus operates in the colosseum providing members with a player versus player combat experience. Last week I mentioned that stats were in the making and were causing me problems and headaches. This week‚Ä¶ Stats went live! This now means that every players level was reset to Level 1 and experience is now a climbing difficulty. For every level a player earns, they can now purchase a maximum of 3 stat points. These stats can be assigned to strength (to increase your attack power), defense (to reduce incoming damage) or agility (to mildly increase your chances of hitting your opponent). This is all completely custom. You can assign your points however you please making combat a truly dynamic experience! Obviously over the coming weeks, there will be changes that need to be made as stats develop. It could be that limits on the difference between player stats in combat need to be added so that people aren‚Äôt getting one shotted, it could be that the bonus added by stats needs increasing or decreasing. For now, stats are in! Previously, experience was awarded at 20xp per win with 5 wins being required to level up, no matter the level. This now works on a sliding scale ‚Äî 50xp required to reach level 2, 100xp for level 3, 150xp for level 4 etc etc. This means the higher your level, the more you have to win to level up again. BUT ‚Äî You no longer get 20xp per fight unless the person your fighting has an identical amount of used stat points. Experience is now worked out in the following manner: (loser strength+defense+agility minus winner strength+denfense+agility) + 20\. If the above equation works out to less than 5xp, the player will be awarded 5xp. otherwise, you will get the amount it works out to. So, beat a player with higher stats than you and you‚Äôll be awarded in kind! Stats are all viewable on the new and improved_ [_http://www.turtacus.com_](http://www.turtacus.com/) _website! I look forward to seeing how stats effects the game in the coming days and appreciate any feedback given._‚Äù **Rynem**
