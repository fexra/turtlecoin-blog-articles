**_Quarantine Isolation day 34:_** _A prominent theory is developing that asserts ‘outside’ has simply been a simulation to distract us from our true goal of dominating the meme-coin arms race._

## Developer Updates

_This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL project they’re working on. It’s a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we’re happy to see them all and it shows that we’re an active community._

## TRTLApps.io

TRTLApps.io is a service I have been working on for the past few months which aims to make it easy for developers of apps and games to integrate TurtleCoin into their projects.

_I’m not saying we have secret technology such as_ **_NipAlert_**_, but I’m also not saying we don’t have it either._

The service is still in early development and not open to the public, but if you would like to experiment with the API ping me on Discord and I can give you an invitation code.

This past week I’ve been working on a better way for saving and loading the service wallet files to storage, which will allow for periodically creating checkpoints. If we detect that the wallet is in a bad state for any reason(missed transactions while scanning blocks for example), we will be able to rewind the last saved checkpoint we know was in a good state and rescan.

Big thanks to the devs in the discord channels for all your help and patience, and sajo for trying out the service with his game “”Chukwa’s Labyrinth””!

## ExtraHash

Hey guys. Long time no talk, it’s ExtraHash, your GUI wallet maintainer. Not a whole lot has been going on with the GUI wallet lately.. it’s basically reached a point of stability, where new issues aren’t really getting opened up, it seems like everyone is pretty pleased with it overall. So that’s a really nice place to be.

That being said, some things are going to be coming down the pipeline with Karai that I’m looking forward to supporting in the wallet and seeing what that’s going to look like. Additionally, I’m thinking it might be a good time to go for a redesign, since we redesigned the home page. Perhaps we might want to make the interface fit the new brand guidelines better and drop the moniker Proton once and for all, and just release as the TurtleCoin® wallet.

What do you guys think? Drop me a ping in #dev\_marketing if anybody wants to discuss this further.

**Description:** two RX580s with Samsung memory.

**Secrets**: add objects for drying, does not add to more hashrate, but makes the extra heat useful :)

We built a number of rigs in our Prague office, this one is a one of my friend’s :)

## Shoutouts & Thanks

This is the place to mention someone in the community who has done something nice or deserves recognition.

* **greywolf** thank you to these guys who helped along my journey in the land of TurtleCoin (i think chronologically): Ereptor, Turtle?, zpalmtree, Chef, auto-joe, cryptohno, labaylabay, Crappyrules, morpheus, Mufalito, Japakar, Rogerrobers, ExtraHash, Pluton, and LeoCuvée
* **rock** Thanks to everyone who’s been helping out with this whole karai exit scam plan design scheme

## A Bit Extra

Worth mentioning are the things that the TRTL community creates that aren’t necessarily TRTL related but still pretty cool. One that I’d like to show you this week is our resident audio-therapist, Oiboo. You might know him from such creations as Turtle Arcade, Turtle Simulator, and a big helper with Chukwa’s Labyrinth. This entire roundup was written with his musical works playing in the background, and I wanted you guys to check it out, he’s got a lot of good chunes for you guys to rock out to while you code.

If you don’t listen to the entire playlist, your mom will die in her sleep tonight.

Listen to these as well for extra TRTL vitality
