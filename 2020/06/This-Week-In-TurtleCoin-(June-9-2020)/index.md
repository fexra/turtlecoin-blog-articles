This week we saw lots of new faces in the chat and many new users asking all the great questions new users ask, and as a bonus, diff has gone back to a sensible level. All in all, a good week!

## Developer Updates

_This is a place where anybody in our community can submit a post about the TRTL project they’re working on. It’s a great way to attract helpers for your project and show people what to keep an eye out for. We encourage you to show works in progress as well as finished products, as we’re happy to see them all and it shows that we’re an active community._

## Brand Updates

![](./images/0bBVRB_faEXe0RZpB.gif)

There have been a few changes made to the TurtleCoin® branding over the last few months and we felt the need to summarize a few of the high points as we’re very proud of these changes.

## Branding Guide

The branding guide for TurtleCoin received a refresh a few months ago. It contains updated guidelines on how to properly reference the registered Trademark, proper use of logos or symbols, the wordmark, as well as font selections and the new color scheme (don’t worry, the green isn’t going anywhere).

## Presentation Slide Templates

Rock also took the time to create a slick new set of presentation slide templates that anyone can use when presenting on TurtleCoin topics, technologies, or general promotions. These templates present a crisp, clean, and consistent message to those we wish to introduce to various TurtleCoin topics.

## Website

For those of you who haven’t noticed, the official website at [https://turtlecoin.lol ](https://turtlecoin.lol/)also received a much needed facelift. Rock, @mrrovot, and a few others contributed to the new simplier design that follows the new guidelines. We’ll be working on updating a few other core maintained site(s) to reflect the new look and feel across the board.

[TurtleCoinTurtleCoin is a decentralized Peer-2-Peer Open Source electronic currency. It's easy to get, completely private, and…turtlecoin.lol](https://turtlecoin.lol/)

## TurtleCoin.com

Those of you that frequent the chat have likely seen a few interactions that haven’t always ended very… well between a few community members and uaoverall. uaoverall _allegedly_ secured the domain name [turtlecoin.com](https://turtlecoin.com/) almost two years ago by purchasing it from a domain name squatter for much more than the fair market rates that a registrar like NameCheap charges.

![](./images/0v9j2a9LovL-tRh-8.gif)

Since then, he’s forwarded [turtlecoin.com](https://turtlecoin.com/) to [turtlecoin.lol](https://turtlecoin.lol/) in the hopes that one day the official project site would be migrated from [turtlecoin.lol](https://turtlecoin.lol/) to [turtlecoin.com](https://turtlecoin.com/). Unfortunately, without getting into the details, every time discussion came up, things always ended up very heated. Suffice it to say, the topic coming up every few months the past two years starts to grind a little bit (on both sides).

With this in mind, IBurnMyCd stepped up to the plate and worked out a deal with uaoverall to transfer the ownership of the domain to the same organization that holds the Trademark.

![](./images/0qdXjBfvm0itmoMTx.gif)

The most interesting part of all of this is that this very well might be the very first actual contract paid entirely in TurtleCoin. While the details of the contract aren’t being shared (to protect both parties), it’s very cool whenever TurtleCoin is used for a real-world transaction.

With this deal, the team is happy to report that the [turtlecoin.com](https://turtlecoin.com/) domain name is now securely in a member of Core’s hands. For now, the domain is retaining its forwarding role to [turtlecoin.lol](https://turtlecoin.lol/) until such a time that the community may decide that switching from [turtlecoin.lol](https://turtlecoin.com/) to [turtlecoin.com](https://turtlecoin.com/) makes sense.

Thankfully, we can now put this issue to rest and leave it well behind us as the community moves forward with everything everyone is doing to make TurtleCoin the go to network for fast, safe, and fun transactions.

## Karai Updates

This week I did a significant amount of work getting the channel joining process working, and we had our first connection to a karai transaction channel on a remote network :) Since then, a few users seem to have forked the software and have pinged the stagenet a few times. It is definitely interesting to see.

![](./images/0yTy3PuESGL5AvLiH.gif)

The work done regarding connecting to channels is the process that is outlined in IBMCDs hackmd diagram for building a cert authority.

[Node to Coordinator Communication - HackMDNode to Coordinator Communication \`\`\`sequence Participant Node Participant Coordinator Note righthackmd.io](https://hackmd.io/@ZL2uKk4cThC4TG0z7Wu7sg/H1Ubn6d9L)

Here is a link to the rough layout of what we are doing, it is a large diagram showing the process that takes place when a node is connecting to a karai transaction channel. In short a websocket connection is made to the channel coordinator, if it is your first time joining the channel, your client will generate new keys via ed25519 and do an exchange and signing process with the channel coordinator. If your certificate is good, you will be allowed to connect.

Here is a summary of the steps for connecting to channels with an indicator of what is done so far, which is about half way, with most of the difficult stuff done.

// \[✔️\] Coord: Generates Secret Key (CA:SK)and Public Key (CA:PK)  
// \[✔️\] Coord: Signs CA:PK with CA:SK(CA:S)  
// \[❌\] Coord: Publishes CA:S & CA:PK in pointer record  
// \[✔️\] Node: Generates Secret Key (N1:SK) and Public Key(N1:PK)  
// \[✔️\] Node: Initial Connection Sends N1:PK to Coord  
// \[✔️\] Coord: Signs N1:PK with CA:SK (N1:S)  
// \[❌\] Coord: Sends CA:N1:S to Node  
// \[ \] Node: Verifies N1:S using known CA:PK from pointer (Good Coordinator)  
// \[ \] Node: Signs N1:PK with N1:SK (N1:S)  
// \[ \] Node: Sends N1:S to Coord  
// \[ \] Coord: Hashes (N1:S) and signs with CA:SK Node1 Cert (N1:C)  
// \[ \] Coord: Sends N1:C to Node  
// \[ \] Node: Requests Cert Revocation List  
// \[ \] Coord: Sends CRL to Node

When I finish with this, I will be adding a new transaction type, Join Transactions which allow a channel to track and announce new peers joining the swarm. This will help shorten the already short amount of time to sync your history when reconnecting to a channel.

Some things coming after that are:  
\- subgraph construction  
\- graph explorer  
\- libraries for go and js clients

## TRTLNIC

![](./images/0mNx6QuMn0hWQW-UH)

Now that we’ve had a steady run of OpenNIC Tier-2 servers running for well over 6 months, it’s time to put on our big boy pants and actually apply to OpenNIC to accept .trtl domains everywhere. To do so though, we need to graduate from the github based DNS management to something more… automated.

I’ve been working the last few days to continue work I was doing on building a nifty REST API that can be used to register, manage, and perform basic functions with .trtl domains. Think of it like… like… your favorite unnamed registrars. This will make maintaining the system of .trtl domains a lot easier, have built in payment support using TurtlePay, live updates, basic managed DNS for the domains, and a few other cool features I’m baking in. No, I haven’t published any of the code yet, but I’m working to assemble it as quickly as possible. Most of the difficult stuff is done so at this point, there’s very little to do except put together the actual web interface that talks to the API. Hopefully I’ll have more news to post on this in the next few days/weeks.”

## Moving Up!

_It’s always good to be recognized! These are the people who gained new roles in the community this week!_

Moving down in this case! We removed the Ninja role, which was basically just me on there most of the time anyway. It felt counterproductive to have the highest rank be the most inactive so we removed it to get closer to the purple guys :)

We also created a moderator role for the possible impending changes to the market talk rules.

## Free Advertising

_This is a spot to spam anything TurtleCoin related that you would like to advertise, it’s free to put an ad in the roundup._

Mine on MuxDux, the pool with the grassiest roots around! [https://trtl.muxdux.com](https://trtl.muxdux.com/) Important Public Service Announcement for TipBot This message goes out to every single one of you in our cryptocurrency Discord servers to raise awareness about the one and only TipBot we have all come to know and love. Did you know that you can get an invite link to invite TipBot to a new server by direct messaging the bot with the command ‘.invite’? You can also write the message ‘.invite’ in the bots channel to get a link there. We are calling out for everybody’s help with doing this so that we can see the TipBot’s usage explode to new heights globally. All we really need you to do is invite the TipBot to other discord servers that it is not yet in so that we can continue to teach people around the world that cryptocurrency transacting can be quick, easy, and user-friendly. This TipBot allows you to send crypto coins to anyone on Discord, 24/7, with no fee due to the utilization of off-chain tipping. The TipBot also includes a built-in faucet feature that is an engaging way for getting newbies started with learning how to navigate the bot’s system and giving them possibly their first ever crypto coins to mess around with. This faucet operates by the user command ‘.take’ and when utilized it gives out a small stack of a random coin absolutely free (one of WRKZ, DEGO, BTCMZ, TRTL, and DOGE respectively). This command is currently able to be used once every 24 hours. On the flip side, if you’re feeling generous you can tip the TipBot directly with one of those coins and it will be added into the faucet’s stockpile. In the same giving spirit, you can also directly donate any of the supported cryptocurrencies directly to the TipBot’s open source developer (@pluton#8888 on discord \[id: 386761001808166912\]) using command ‘.donate’ to help keep the bot up and running for the long run. Pluton says that ultimately his main goal is to spread awareness of cryptocurrency through tips and get more people from all over the world involved. As always you can type command ‘.help’ to see a full list of all the command prompts provided by this impressive bot! Thanks for reading our special announcement and don’t forget to invite!!
