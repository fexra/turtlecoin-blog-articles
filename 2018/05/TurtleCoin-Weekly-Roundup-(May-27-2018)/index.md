# TurtleCoin Weekly Roundup (May 27, 2018)

May 28, 2018

---

This week we grew to over 11,000 Turtles, passed 1 million in tips on Canti’s new RainBorg, and more!

## A NEW CHALLENGE

**TurtleRiddle —** _“Even though the first leg of the TurtleRiddle hasn’t been completed yet I’m going to put out another branch. I’m expecting these to be a little more solvable than certain levels of the first set, so it might be a race to the finish. Because of this I want to release it at a set time. The second branch of the TurtleRiddle will be uploaded at 22:00 UTC on Thursday, May 31\. There will be over 500,000 TRTL total in the levels of the riddle. Good luck :)”_**— cvstn**

Canti’s Unnamed Web Wallet

**Unnamed Web Wallet — “**_This week brought with it some great insight as my (still as of yet unnamed) web wallet finally hit testnet open beta! After about five weeks of silent work, I decided it was finally time to open the doors to the public. It seems to be a hit, which just makes me all the more excited to get it up and running to its full potential! Feel free to check it out!_” **— Canti**

Fexra’s Web Wallet

**TurtleWallet — “**_Since the beta launch, I have made quite some progress with TurlteWallet. Dozens of bugs have been discovered, and some logic behind the scenes is being improved to create a more stable experience. So far most bugs have been addressed and I have added currency conversion support for CAD and AUD. There is still a lot to do, which can be followed in our discord chat:_ [_chat.turtlewallet.io_](http://chat.turtlewallet.io/)” **— Fexra**

**Testnets —** _“TurtleCoin now has an official place for organising Testnets. These are networks where we can test things out before going live on the actual TurtleCoin network,aka mainnet. The two web wallets are running on the one called Vico-7xT. Check out the Org GitHub repo”_ **_— SoreGums_**

SNAILS ON A MF’IN PLANE

**TurtleCoin Snail Races — _“_**_This idea came about after hearing all the hype about the Kentucky derby and preakness horse races and I thought hmm horse races is only for rich people what about races for the common person using turtle coin. The community voted between 3 different species of snails and the people chose the mystery snail. They also voted for our snails to be jade colored to represent the color of the turtles. Gonna start farming within the month and hope for weekly races by end of July early august._ **_” — Roger Robers_**

**Gladiator Bot —** _“Gladiator Bot is making progress. We now have a fully functional command base for the taunting, challenging, bowing to opponent and shooting. We also have a working battle sequence where two players can battle it out. As it stands, this has only just begun but as time goes on, this will become turn based and allow for a multitude of attacks with a leveling system in the pipeline.” —_ **_Rynem aka “Caesar”_**

**API Docs —** _“tmac25#9825 wrapped up writing code examples for Shell, JS, PHP Walletd client libraries. This was a HUGE feat. arthurk is updating the the Python library so that it can be included here. Since this project is near completion (at least the first pass) now, we are looking for feedback on it” — Ar-x_

**Dockerize-teh-wurld — _“_**_The dockerized, redundant mining pool design took a hit this week. Brief lessons learned are:_

_(1) Avoid oversubscribing your docker VMs, so that runaway backup processes on unrelated containers (hey there, pg\_dump on a loop with no wait time) don’t cause an OOM (out-of-memory) and kill of the daemon. It doesn’t like that, it can (and did) corrupt the blockchain. Mitigations are to apply CPU/memory rate limits to all your containers._

_(2) Before bragging to all and sundry that your redundant design “saved the day”, be aware that due to <unknown factors>, an unsynced daemon will still permit inbound connections, meaning your pool will by mining against stale blockchain data. Mitigations are likely to be using the pool API to query the last-found global block, and raise an alarm if it’s older than an few min, or updating the pool to refuse to talk to stale daemons. Other than that, tom and I had a civilized discussion (slowest PR ever!) about handling stateful data on Docker containers, reached “consensus” (haha), and are well on the way towards official automated docker image builds ;)”_ **_— FunkyPenguin_**

**TRTLBotSharp —** _“Madk wanted someone to fix some bugs and add some features on his TrtlBott++ git, so I volunteered to take it a step further and do a full port/rewrite to C#, since I know he’s a fan of the language. At the time of writing this, it’s about 90–95% done!”_ **_— Canti_**

**Sajo’s Wiki —** _“The new wiki frontend is ready! It sports TurtleCoin colors, a fluid sidebar, table of contents, and it’s hosted on a memorable domain! xD Check it out”_
