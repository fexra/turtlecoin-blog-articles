This week was one of the best yet! Between playing the games you guys made with your TurtleCities pages, and ones you wanted to watch on TwitchTurtle, I’m spent! Awesome community participation this week, and we’re really looking forward to next week!

# Developer Community

**Trtl Driver** — As turtles we all have a need for speed, scratch that itch by playing the “Turtlefied” version of Yu Suzuki’s arcade classic “OUTRUN”. Discover this and many more games @ “games.turtacus.com” — a showcase for all the diverse talents of the TRTL community. If you want your game/ project featured or are interested in learning more about game development, please message me @ Trt.Simulator@gmail.com or drop into the TRTL Discord! **— Oiboo**

**TurtleCities** — Wow, it has been a big week for all of you that put up homepages on TurtleCities! For those of you that don’t know, we made a just for fun project last week that lets people sign up for a single floppy disk worth of web hosting for an old school home page and to show the internet just how cool you can be with only 1.44mb to express yourself. I’m still deciding on “upgrades” to offer, but currently thinking about doing a “Dual density floppy upgrade” for 2,000 TRTL, and I’d like to see what adding some shell accounts to certain users would be like. The obvious next step is to release the BBS system I’ve been tinkering with…. But that’s another story :D **\-RockSteady**

**TurtleEDU** — I’ve completed all of the course material for the first course on TurtleEDU, which I’m going to call “TurtleCoin 101”. It’s a class that will take someone who is new to cryptocurrencies and turn them into a certified TurtleCoin user by the time they finish. It doesnt take long, and the class is divided up into easy sections. I’d like to add some finishing touches, but I get the feeling I may be overdoin it, so video/audio content might wait until after the beta launch for people with the “student” role. Remember, if you’re interested in being a trial user of TurtleEDU, be sure to type `*student` in the discord to automatically enroll you in Turtle School :D  
The next classes I'd like to work on are "Contributor 101" which will guide the user through how to use Github for version control to create and modify guides and wikis, and then "Developer 101" which will be a guided tutorial to using the TurtleCoin API using the docs on [https://api-docs.turtlecoin.lol](https://api-docs.turtlecoin.lol/)  
Fexra is still working on the visual theme for TurtleEDU, and we'd like to get it skinned up before you guys get to try it out on December 9th, our one year and 1 million blocks anniversary! **\- RockSteady**

**Core Team Update** — A new core developer has been officially added to the team. He has significant amounts of contributions to the core suite and is the project leader behind the Golang port of the TurtleCoin Core Suite — We are very pleased to introduce Rashed to you guys :) You are probably already well acquainted with seeing his name in the roundups and hearing about him in podcasts, and we’re very excited to bring him aboard. Great job, sir! **— RockSteady**

**lite-blocks** — This is the TRTL version of XMR’s Fluffy Blocks which is being implemented to increase the propagation of blocks in the network in a much efficient and faster way. Work is progressing slowly day by day as I am in middle of my semester exams.  
So what are lite-blocks? We all know that new transactions propagate throughout the network and are stored in the transaction pool of every daemon.. whenever a miner finds a block the daemon removes those transactions from the pool and adds them to the block and then propagate that block throughout the network.. you see transactions are a heavy thing.. they make up most of the size of the block.. it is just an overhead to send the transactions again which the other daemon already has.. also since it increases the payload size it would take time to propagate it throughout the network.. To solve this problem instead of sending the block with all those transactions we just send their hashes which are much less in size.. the receiver checks for those transactions in its transaction pool.. if it has all of them it creates the block by itself and adds it to its database.. but if it couldn’t find any of those transactions.. it requests the sender to those missing transactions only.. hence the lite-blocks essentially contain the block header and the transaction hashes which are present in it or it contains the block header along with the transaction hashes and the requested transactions.. this technique will help reduce the payload for the propagation of block throughout the network and hence result in much healthy network and I guess less orphans too **— rashedmyt**

**Windows on Travis** — Got bored by studying for my exams and thought lets take a look whether travis has given support for c++ projects on windows or not. To my surprise, they have supported it very soon and I thought lets get the work started. After working for a couple of hours to figure out how to get started and get things done, also not to forget the long waiting times for the build to just see the red error messages. I have finally managed to get the build working perfectly and deploying. Thanks to iburnmycd and zpalmtree for helping me with disabling the builds to just test the windows build. **— rashedmyt**

**trtl.rocks** — Here is a quick breakdown of what I’ve done on [http://trtl.rocks](http://trtl.rocks/) over the last two weeks **— andrew | trtl.rocks**

• Restructured the database  
• Added fuzzy search and pagination to the nodes and pools page  
• Added node fees to the node table  
• All The Pools — expanded the pool service to grab data from forknote and node.js pools, as well as cryptonote.social  
• Added pool fee types, when available  
• Updated the pool hashrate graph to display unknown hashrates  
• Fixed mobile nav

**TurtlePay™ —** Quite a bit of progress has been made this week in the Blockchain Data Collection Agent (BDCA) with the sole purpose of collecting and caching the blockchain in a database friendly way. Building a strong backend distribution system for TurtlePay™ is paramount as the scale and flexibility is at stake. Returning data as quickly as possible gives us the ability to scale to massive unprecedented levels seldom seen in Blockchain applications. Initial testing has shown the ability to provide data to the wallets at a rate of about 100,000 blocks per minute. The payloads provided to wallets are substantially reduced in size to include just the needed information for scanning for funds sent to our wallet(s). As a byproduct of the streamlined payloads it is possible to create a fast, efficient, and versatile block explorer built on this database backend. Look forward to more information to come in the coming days and weeks and keep up with the latest information in #dev\_turtlepay **— IBurnMyCd**

**Swanson Clicker** — Swanson Clicker has come a long way in a short amount of time! Thank you to all the \~76 unique users who have clicked Swanson whether that would be 1 time or 1,000 times! Hopefully your Pineapple Farms and Snail Racers are doing great. In the future, I will be attempting to gracefully implement items and more statistics so bear with me if you lose your progress. If you have not tried Swanson Clicker yet, then you’re missing out! Special thanks to Oiboo in discord for this awesome title-card for Swanson Clicker. **— Xaz**

**WalletBackend / WalletGreen rewrite —** Finished rewriting zedwallet this week with the new wallet-backend I’ve been working on everything seems to work well. Apparently it has some issues on Windows. Shouldn’t be too much effort to fix, though. I started writing some documentation on the wallet file encryption format, and the wallet JSON format. You can get that here — <https://github.com/turtlecoin/wallet-file-interaction> if you’re interested in interacting with wallet files manually, perhaps to build your own wallet backend implementation. I’ve got some examples of how to open a wallet file up there, currently in C# and C++. If you’ve got a favorite language and you think you’re likely to want to be able to open wallets without the help of an RPC interface, let me know, and I can probably code up an example for that language too. Next I need to get turtle-service rewritten, so you can make API calls to it from all your favorite languages. Oh — I finished writing that article I was talking about on how transactions work. Just giving it a bit of a review then it should be ready to publish. Thanks to IBMCD for reviewing my code :)) **— Zpalm**

**Article** — I wrote that article on transactions I was talking about in past roundups — you can check it out [here](https://blog.turtlecoin.lol/archives/how-a-transaction-is-born-and-how-wallet-syncing-works/). It goes into depth on how wallet syncing works, and how a transaction is made — it’s a bit complicated, but hopefully a few people can learn something **— Zpalm**
