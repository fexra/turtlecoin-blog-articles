# This Week In TurtleCoin (July 15)

## This week we became more than a meme coin, went live with a new algorithm, got a step closer to compiling on Raspberry Pi and hung out with podcast celebs :)

Turtle-Pi

**Turtle-Pi ‚Äî** _Turtlepi came one step closer to a reality this week. I would definitely call it a partial success that some users and myself have come closer to getting the TurtleCoin daemon and wallet to compile properly on the raspberry pi, but there is still more work to do. The ultimate goal would be to keep a rolling release going of the Turtlepi software that contains everything Turtle related on a weekly update. Some day in the near future, you will be able to download a light raspbian image, flash it to a sd card then boot up your pi and have a local web wallet along with all kinds of other Turtley goods pre-loaded for new users and hackers._ **_‚Äî_ crappyrules**

Paper Wallet

**Foldable and Sealable Paperwallet ‚Äî** _This is an Paperwallet like the ones on bitcoinpaperwallet.com but for Turtlecoin. The Seed Phrase, View Key and Spend Key are hidden inside the foldable area. Your Turtlecoin Wallet address and an (by you) generated QR-Code for your address is on the visible area on the front. It can also be sealed with anit-tamper stickers which can be ordered on ebay. Here you can see how to fold it_ <https://i.imgur.com/iJyQlVF.png> _‚Äî_**jarlave#9941**

**Turtacus ‚Äî** _Turtacus facilitates player versus player combat in the colosseum! Players can enter and challenge a player to a fight to the death, winner takes 0.01% of Turtacus‚Äôs prize wallet every fight! This week was the first week that stats have been introduced and with some players still getting to grips with this, it‚Äôs been interesting! It‚Äôs been fun seeing the difference that stats have made and I look forward to make improvements in the future!_ [_www.turtacus.com_](http://www.turtacus.com/) _is now the go to place for checking the leaderboard and I am in the process of trying to get adsense on the page to allow a bit of income to fund his bank more! If anyone has any knowledge on adsense, I‚Äôd appreciate the input as they keep rejecting the page!_ **_‚Äî Rynem_**

turtlecoin-rpc-go

**TurtleCoin-rpc-go ‚Äî** _This project is a Golang implementation of a high level wrapper to make RPC requests. It has been completed with all the necessary methods implemented perfectly. The response of the request is similar to a curl request made. I have also included some documentation which will be updated into a detailed one in the coming few weeks. Entire project follows Go naming conventions and got an A+ on the goreportcard at_ <https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin-rpc-go> **‚Äî Rashedyt**

zedwallet

**zedwallet ‚Äî** _This week zedwallet got a_ `_sendall_` _command. As you would expect, this sends all your funds! It‚Äôs just a tad easier than working out how much to subtract for the fee and typing in the exact amount._ **_‚Äî zpalm_**

[Adds a send\_all command to zedwallet by ZedPea ¬∑ Pull Request #344 ¬∑ turtlecoin/turtlecoinI still need to do a few more sanity checks to check all the edge cases behave as expected, but I think it&#39;s good‚Ä¶github.com](https://github.com/turtlecoin/turtlecoin/pull/344/files)

walletd

**walletd errors ‚Äî** _Before, when trying to open a wallet which didn‚Äôt exist in walletd, it would give an error ‚Äúwrong wallet version‚Äù. With (a lot of) help from Zpalm, I fixed it to show an error ‚ÄúFile doesn‚Äôt exist; check your spelling?‚Äù, and additionally takes the argument and appends a ‚Äò.wallet‚Äô to it. If a file exists of that name, it suggests, ‚Äúmaybe you meant xyz.wallet?‚Äù. Or, if not, gives the former error. Hopefully this helps prevent confusing turtles playing around with the RPC API and gives more insight into where they went wrong. Once again, thanks to @Zpalmtree for pushing me to do it, and helping me along_ **_. ‚Äî sajo8_**

**roger‚Äôs snail races ‚Äî**_I checked on my tadpoles today and noticed I no longer have tadpoles there are frogs inhabiting the pool now! Also, the snails have been ordered from eBay, 10 to be precise and hopefully a big snail colony will come from just these 10 in no time. Thanks for all your support turtle team :) races begin soon!!_ **_‚Äî rogerrobers_**
